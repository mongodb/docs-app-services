Atlas Triggers execute application and database logic. Triggers
can respond to events or use pre-defined schedules.

Triggers listen for events of a configured type. Each Trigger links to a
specific :doc:`Atlas Function </functions>`.
When a Trigger observes an event that matches your
configuration, it *"fires."* The Trigger passes this event object as the
argument to its linked Function.

A Trigger might fire on:

- A specific *operation type* in a given Collection.
- An authentication event, such as user creation or deletion.
- A scheduled time.

App Services keeps track of the latest execution time for each
Trigger.

.. _trigger-types:

Trigger Types
-------------

App Services supports three types of triggers:

- :doc:`Database triggers </triggers/database-triggers>`
  respond to document insert, changes, or deletion. You can configure 
  Database Triggers for each linked MongoDB collection.

- :doc:`Authentication triggers </triggers/authentication-triggers>`
  respond to user creation, login, or deletion.

- :doc:`Scheduled triggers </triggers/scheduled-triggers>`
  execute functions according to a pre-defined schedule.

.. _trigger-limitations:

Limitations
-----------

Atlas Function Constraints Apply
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Triggers invoke Atlas Functions. This means they have the same
constraints as all Atlas Functions.

:ref:`Learn more about Atlas Function constraints.<function-constraints>`

Maximum Executions Per Second
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

App Services limits the execution of Trigger
Functions. A Trigger can execute up to 2500 times per second. When a
Trigger calls a Function, this call goes into a queue. When capacity
becomes available, App Services executes the Function call.

.. note::

   Your application's execution rate may be lower than 2500 per second. This
   varies depending on your Atlas instance size.

Database Triggers with *event ordering* work differently. Each ordered
Trigger processes events in sequence. App Services waits for each event
execution in the sequence to complete. Then, it handles the next event. Only
one sequence for a given ordered Trigger executes at a time.

Number of Triggers Cannot Exceed Available Change Streams
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

App Services limits the total number of Database Triggers. The size of your
Atlas cluster drives this limit.

Each Atlas cluster tier has a maximum number of supported change
streams. A Database Trigger requires its own change stream. Other App Services
also use change streams, such as Atlas Device Sync. Database Triggers
may not exceed the number of available change streams.

tiers. <mongodb-service-limitations-change-streams>`
