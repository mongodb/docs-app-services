An Edge Server-compatible service is your Atlas destination to create, delete, 
or monitor your Edge Server instances. 

There are two types of services that enable you to use Edge Server:

- **Edge Server Service**: use this option if you want clients to connect to an
  Edge Server instance with MongoDB Drivers and tools. It infers and updates 
  the schema from the documents you insert, and provides a developer experience
  familiar to MongoDB developers. This service is incompatible with 
  Atlas Device SDK; it rejects incoming Atlas Device SDK connections.
- **Device Sync Service (with Edge Server)**: use this option if you want to 
  develop client apps using Atlas Device SDK and MongoDB Drivers and tools. 
  This option involves more strict schema enforcement, which the SDKs use to 
  automatically sync objects across devices and handle conflict resolution.

Regardless of which type of service you choose, Edge Servers use Device Sync 
to sync data between the Edge Server instance and Atlas.

.. important:: You can't add Atlas Device SDK later to an Edge Server Service

   You can always add Edge Servers to a Device Sync Service. But you can't use
   Atlas Device SDK connections with an Edge Server Service. 
   
   Users are not portable between services. If you start with an Edge Server 
   Service, but later want to develop apps using Atlas Device SDK, there is no 
   way to transfer any users in your Edge Service to a new Device Sync Service.

Before You Begin
----------------

   .. tab::
      :tabid: ui

      You need the following to manage Edge Servers in the Atlas UI:

      - .. include:: /includes/prereqs/atlas-account.rst

   .. tab::
      :tabid: api

      You need the following to manage Edge Servers with the Admin API:

      - .. include:: /includes/prereqs/atlas-admin-api-key.rst

      - .. include:: /includes/prereqs/api-project-app-id.rst

.. _create-edge-server-service:

Create a Service for Edge Server
--------------------------------

You can create an Edge Server-compatible service in Data Services or App 
Services. 

- You might select Data Services when you just want to get started building
  with Edge Server or Device Sync and Edge Server, and don't need other 
  App Services. You can create an Edge Server Service from Data Services.
- You might select App Services when you want to bundle your service with 
  authentication, Functions, Triggers, HTTPS Endpoints, or Values and Secrets.
  You can create a Device Sync Service from App Services, and add Edge Server
  to it.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Create a Data Service
      :tabid: atlas-service

      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Navigate to the Data Services UI

            When you select a project in the Atlas UI Project dashboard, the
            :guilabel:`Data Services` tab displays by default.

            If you are in :guilabel:`App Services` or :guilabel:`Charts`,
            select the :guilabel:`Data Services` tab.

         .. step:: Choose Device & Edge Sync

            In the left sidebar, browse to the :guilabel:`Services` section. 
            Select :guilabel:`Device & Edge Sync`.

         .. step:: Create a Service

            Select the type of service you want to create, and follow the
            prompts to create an Edge Server Service or Device Sync Service.

            After creating an Edge Server Service, you're able to immediately
            add Edge Server instances.

            If you create a Device Sync Service, click :guilabel:`Edge Server` 
            in the left navigation. This opens a list where you can add and 
            view Edge Server instances.

            Click the :guilabel:`Add a server` button, and follow the
            prompts to name and create your new Edge Server instance.

   .. tab:: Create an App Service
      :tabid: app-service

      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Create a Device Sync App

            Refer to the documentation to :ref:`create-app`.

            When you choose your App type, select ``Device Sync``. You can add
            Edge Servers to your Device Sync App after you configure 
            Device Sync.

         .. step:: Add Edge Server Instances to Your Device Sync Service

            While viewing your Device Sync Service, click 
            :guilabel:`Edge Server` in the left navigation. This opens a
            list where you can add and view Edge Server instances.

            Click the :guilabel:`Add a server` button, and follow the
            prompts to name and create your new Edge Server instance.

.. important:: Required Field

   Documents that you want to sync with an Edge Server must contain an ``_id`` 
   field whose type varies depending on the service type: 
   
   - Edge Server Service: Type ``ObjectId``
   - Device Sync Service: Type ``ObjectId``, ``String``, ``Long``, ``Int``, ``UUID``

   Any documents without this field cannot sync to an Edge Server.

Supported Authentication Providers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Edge Server supports a subset of authentication providers. Supported 
authentication providers vary depending on whether you're connecting with
Atlas Device SDK or using a MongoDB URI to connect with a MongoDB Driver 
or tool.

You must enable at least one of these providers to enable clients to connect
to an Edge Server instance.

Supported Atlas Device SDK Authentication Providers

.. _create-edge-server-instance:

Create an Edge Server Instance
------------------------------

After creating an Edge Server-compatible service, you can add Edge Servers 
to it. The service can handle multiple Edge Servers, each of which has its own 
registration key.

.. tabs-realm-admin-interfaces::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: ui

      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Add a server

            Click :guilabel:`Add a server`. You're prompted to name your 
            Edge Server.

            The UI provides an installation script, which you can copy and 
            paste into the terminal on the device where you want to install 
            the Edge Server code. You also get a token, which you will use 
            when you configure the Edge Server instance.

         .. step:: Install and Configure the Edge Server code

            Copy and paste the installation script into the terminal on the
            device where you want to install the Edge Server code. For more 
            details, refer to :ref:`edge-server-install-and-configure`.

            After you configure and start the Edge Server instance, its 
            :guilabel:`Health` status in the Edge Server dashboard changes
            from :guilabel:`Pending` to :guilabel:`Active`.

   .. tab::
      :tabid: api

      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Authenticate a MongoDB Atlas User

            .. include:: /includes/api-authenticate-instructions.rst

         .. step:: Call the Create Edge Server Instance Endpoint

            Call the 
            :admin-api-endpoint:`Admin API Create an Edge Server instance <operation/adminCreateEdgeServerInstance>` 
            endpoint to add an Edge Server instance to your service.

            Your request must include:

            - An ``Authorization`` header with your Admin API access
              token as a :mdn:`Bearer token <Web/HTTP/Authentication>`.

            - A ``name`` for the new Edge Server instance

            .. code-block:: shell

               curl -X POST \
                 https://services.cloud.mongodb.com/api/admin/v3.0/groups/{groupId}/apps/{appId}/edge \
                 -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
                 -H 'Authorization: Bearer <AccessToken>' \
                 -d '{
                   "name": "YOUR-EDGE-SERVER-INSTANCE-NAME"
                 }'

            A successful request returns a ``201`` code, as well as a JSON
            object with information about the newly-created Edge Server 
            instance:

            .. code-block:: json

               {
                 "id": "6622b8f5118368b943d228a9",
                 "user_id": "6622b8f5118368b943d2288a",
                 "registration_key": "Qi4GgpvVduwwt4k1w77ZzaQ1n4SdTWC8rLBD9vyTib1w9G3CX2ta8WrJvt3giEK7"
               }

            - ``id``: The unique identifier of the Edge Server instance, of 
              type ObjectId, as a string. You can use this identifier to delete
              or update the Edge Server instance.

            - ``user_id``: The Edge Server itself is a user. This is the unique
              identifier of the Edge Server user, of type ObjectId, as a string.
              You can use this identifier when configuring permissions.

            - ``registration_key``: Save this information. When you install the
              Edge Server code on the host, enter this registration token. The
              Edge Server exchanges this for an API Key that it uses to 
              authenticate with Atlas. You can only use this registration token
              once.

         .. step:: Install the Edge Server code

            Copy and paste the installation script into the terminal on the
            device where you want to install the Edge Server code. For more 
            details, refer to :ref:`edge-server-install-and-configure`.

.. _list-edge-server-instances:

List Edge Server Instances
--------------------------

You can get a list of your Edge Server instances in the Atlas UI,
or from the Admin API.

.. tabs-realm-admin-interfaces::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: ui

      .. include:: /includes/edge/atlas-ui-get-edge-server-list-details.rst

   .. tab::
      :tabid: api

      .. include:: /includes/edge/admin-api-get-edge-server-status.rst

.. _edge-server-details:

Edge Server Instance Details
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The information available in the Edge Server details varies depending on 
whether the Edge Server has been configured and connected to Atlas, or whether
configuration and connection are still pending.

.. _edge-server-pending:

Pending Edge Server Instances
`````````````````````````````

When an Edge Server instance has not yet connected to Atlas for the first time, 
the instance's :guilabel:`Health` status is :guilabel:`Pending`.

While an Edge Server instance is in :guilabel:`Pending` state, you can perform
the following actions from the detail view:

- Rename the instance.
- Review alerts about the instance status.
- Get the instance ID. You can use this to set permissions for this specific 
  instance.
- View the Install command that you can use in the terminal to install the 
  Edge Server code.
- Regenerate the registration token.
- Delete the Edge Server instance.

Once you have successfully configured and connected an Edge Server instance,
the detail view changes to provide additional information.

.. _edge-server-active-or-failed:

Active or Failed Edge Server Instances
``````````````````````````````````````

After you have connected an Edge Server instance to Atlas for the first time, 
the instance's :guilabel:`Health` status changes to :guilabel:`Active`. 

If the Edge Server instance encounters a fatal error, its :guilabel:`Health`
status changes to :guilabel:`Failed`.

You can perform the following actions for active or failed instances:

- Rename the instance.
- Review alerts about the instance status.
- View the date and time of the last connection.
- Get the instance ID. You can use this to set permissions for this specific 
  instance.
- View the instance query. This determines what data syncs between the 
  instance and Atlas, and what data clients can write to the instance.
  Clients can only write data that falls within their permissions, **and**
  the instance's query. For more information, refer to 
  :ref:`specify-edge-server-query`.
- View Metrics about the Edge Server instance. For more information, refer to 
  :ref:`edge-server-metrics`.
- View the instance Logs. For more information, refer to 
  :ref:`edge-server-logs`.
- View version information. This page lists the current version, and the latest
  available version. If the instance falls more than one major version 
  behind the latest available, it enters a :guilabel:`Failed` state and cannot
  sync with Atlas until it is upgraded. For more information, refer to 
  :ref:`upgrade-edge-server-version`.
- View the Install command that you can use in the terminal to install the 
  Edge Server code.
- Regenerate the registration token.
- Delete the Edge Server instance.

.. _delete-edge-server-instance:

Delete an Edge Server Instance
------------------------------

You can delete an individual Edge Server instance from Atlas.

                 -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
                 -H 'Authorization: Bearer <AccessToken>'

            A successful request returns a ``200`` code, and an 
            ``edge_servers`` key whose values is an array of objects containing
            summary details for each Edge Server instance associated with the 
            ``appId``.

            .. code-block:: json

                 -H 'Authorization: Bearer <AccessToken>'

            A successful request returns a ``200`` code.

.. _update-edge-server-data-model:

Update an Edge Server's Data Model
----------------------------------

The process to update a data model varies depending on whether you're using
an Edge Server Service or a Device Sync Service with Edge Server.

Edge Server Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you're using an Edge Server Service, the service automatically updates
fields in the schema when you make changes to the documents you sync.

If you update your schema manually using the UI, and those schema changes
trigger a schema version change, this causes an Edge Server instance with the 
old schema to reboot and wipe itself.

If you're adding a new collection you haven't synced before, you must define
a new schema.

Add a Collection
````````````````

When you want to add a collection to an Edge Server Service, you must add
a schema containing:

- The collection name.
- An ``_id`` field that is of ``ObjectID`` type.

The Edge Server Service automatically infers the other fields from the shape 
of the documents you sync or the documents in the collection.

For information about how to add a schema, refer to :ref:`enforce-a-schema`.

After adding a collection, you must stop and start the Edge Server instance
to pick up the new collection details. For more information, refer to
:ref:`start-and-stop-edge-server`.

Change Fields in a Document
```````````````````````````

When you change the fields in a document using an Edge Server Service,
the service automatically changes the schema to add new fields.

Some changes that you can make through the UI are considered "breaking" 
schema changes. When a "breaking" schema change occurs, any Edge Server 
instance with the old schema reboots and wipes itself. The wipe process 
erases any unsynced data.

.. include:: /includes/important-wipe-and-restart-edge-server-data-loss.rst

For details about which types of changes are considered "breaking" changes,
refer to :ref:`breaking-change-quick-reference`.

Device Sync Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An Edge Server running in a Device Sync Service uses Device Sync rules for
updating a data model.

When a "breaking" schema change occurs, any Edge Server instance with the old 
schema reboots and wipes itself. 

.. include:: /includes/important-wipe-and-restart-edge-server-data-loss.rst

For more information, refer to :ref:`synced-schema-overview`.

.. _troubleshoot-edge-server-instance:

Troubleshoot an Edge Server Instance
------------------------------------

A few conditions can cause an Edge Server instance to enter a ``Failed`` state:

- :ref:`edge-server-exceeds-client-maximum-offline-time`
- :ref:`edge-server-more-than-one-major-version-behind`
- :ref:`edge-server-token-invalid`

.. _edge-server-exceeds-client-maximum-offline-time:

Edge Server is Offline Longer than Client Maximum Offline Time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Edge Server uses Device Sync to sync data between the Edge Server instance and
Atlas. Device Sync has a 
:ref:`Client Maximum Offline Time <client-maximum-offline-time>` setting.

This setting is enabled by default. It trims history to reduce the amount of
storage required in the backing Atlas cluster. The longer the client maximum
offline time, the more storage Atlas requires to keep historical records that
support Sync.

If an Edge Server instance is offline longer than this setting, this is an 
unrecoverable error. You must wipe and restart the instance. Alternately, when 
you bring the instance back online, it will be wiped and restarted 
automatically.

.. include:: /includes/important-wipe-and-restart-edge-server-data-loss.rst

You can change the length of the client maximum offline time in the 
:ref:`sync-settings`.

.. important:: Edge Server Offline Limit is 60 Days

   An Edge Server instance cannot be offline longer than 60 days, no matter
   what setting you set for the client maximum offline time. If the setting
   is unset or greater than 60 days, the Edge Server offline limit is
   60 days.

.. _edge-server-more-than-one-major-version-behind:

Edge Server Instance is More than One Major Version Behind
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Edge Server does not support instances that fall more than one major version
behind the current latest version. If your Edge Server instance falls further 
behind in versions, you must upgrade it to resolve the ``Failed`` state.

For information about upgrading an Edge Server instance, refer to 
:ref:`upgrade-edge-server-version`.

.. _edge-server-token-invalid:

Edge Server Token is Invalid
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the Edge Server instance token is regenerated, and you do not update the 
API Key on the instance itself, it can enter a ``Failed`` state.

For more details about how to update the API Key on the Edge Server instance
after regenerating the Edge Server token, refer to 
:ref:`edge-server-cycle-api-key`.
