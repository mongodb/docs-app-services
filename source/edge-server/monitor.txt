You can view metrics and logs for your Edge Server instances to get a general 
health status, or information about usage, performance, and errors.

You can monitor an instance:

- In the Atlas UI
- In a UI on the local hardware
- Through Admin API calls

You can also forward logs to a MongoDB collection or an external service.

This page contains details about how to view metrics and logs for your 
Edge Server instances, and what information is available.

Before You Begin
----------------

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Atlas UI
      :tabid: atlas-ui

      You need the following to manage Edge Servers in the Atlas UI:

      - .. include:: /includes/prereqs/atlas-account.rst
   
   .. tab:: Local UI
      :tabid: local-ui

      The local UI is enabled by default, and only requires a running
      Edge Server instance.

      On an untrusted host, you can disable the local UI by running the
      following ``edgectl`` command:

      .. code-block:: console

         edgectl config --disable-local-ui=true

   .. tab:: Admin API
      :tabid: api

      You need the following to manage Edge Servers with the Admin API:

      - .. include:: /includes/prereqs/atlas-account.rst

      - .. include:: /includes/prereqs/atlas-admin-api-key.rst

      - .. include:: /includes/prereqs/api-project-app-id.rst

.. _edge-server-status:

Get Edge Server Instance Status
-------------------------------

You can get details about the status of Edge Server instance in a few ways:

- View the Edge Server instance details in the Atlas UI
- View the status details in the local UI
- Use ``edgectl`` to check the status
- Make a request to the relevant Admin API endpoint

The available details vary depending on how you access them.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Atlas UI
      :tabid: atlas-ui

      .. include:: /includes/edge/atlas-ui-get-edge-server-list-details.rst

      The information available when viewing an Edge Server instance varies
      depending on the instance state. For details, refer to 
      :ref:`edge-server-details`.
   
   .. tab:: Local UI
      :tabid: local-ui

      To access the local UI, open a web browser and go to ``localhost``
      on the ``http-port``. You can access the local UI on the default port 
      at: ``http://localhost:80``

      You can change the port by providing an alternative port as an ``Int`` 
      with the following ``edgectl`` flag:

      .. code-block:: console

         edgectl config --http-port=<YOUR-PORT-INT>

   .. tab:: edgectl
      :tabid: edgectl

      .. include:: /includes/edge/edgectl-status.rst

   .. tab:: Admin API
      :tabid: api

      .. include:: /includes/edge/admin-api-get-edge-server-status.rst

.. _edge-server-logs:

Edge Server Logs
----------------

Edge Server uses the following log types:

- :ref:`authentication-logs`: When an Edge Server instance attempts to 
  authenticate with Atlas, or clients attempt to authenticate with an Edge
  Server instance, this generates an authentication log.
- :ref:`logs-sync`: When an Edge Server instance syncs with Atlas, or an 
  Atlas Device SDK client syncs with Edge Server, this generates a Device Sync
  log.

Access Edge Server Logs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can access your logs with the Admin API's
:admin-api-endpoint:`Admin API Retrieve App Services logs <operation/adminGetLogs>`
endpoint. Filter for the ``user_id`` matching the Edge Server instance 
``user_id``. Or you can view logs when viewing :ref:`edge-server-details` in 
the Atlas UI.

Forward Edge Server Logs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can configure log forwarders to store logs in a MongoDB collection or
send them to an external service. For more information, refer to 
:ref:`forward-logs`.

.. _edge-server-metrics:

Edge Server Metrics
-------------------

An Edge Server instance tracks a variety of metrics about:

- The host hardware
- Requests
- Wire Protocol connections, and their activity
- Sync

You can access your metrics data with the Admin API's
:admin-api-endpoint:`Admin API Get Edge Server information <operation/adminGetEdgeServerInstance>`
endpoint. Or you can view a subset of these metrics when viewing 
:ref:`edge-server-details` in the Atlas UI.

The exact metrics returned may be subject to change.
