Once the Edge Server is :ref:`configured <edge-server-configure>` and 
:ref:`running <start-and-stop-edge-server>`, you can connect to it from 
a client application.

.. _edge-server-connect-from-client:

Connect to the Edge Server from a Client
----------------------------------------

To connect to the Edge Server from a client, your app must:

- Use HTTP over port 80.
- Set the Sync URL to the public-accessible DNS address you set in the 
  Edge Server :ref:`config's <edge-server-install-and-configure>` ``hostname`` 
  field.

.. tip::

   While your Edge Server deployment is in development, we recommend connecting
   with HTTP over port 80 for simplicity. Before moving to production, 
   you can coordinate with your Product or Account Representative to configure
   HTTPS with a self-signed certificate.

Example: SwiftUI Template App
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For a quick proof of concept using a template app, these are the 
modifications you can make to the :github:`Swift template app 
<mongodb/template-app-swiftui-todo>` to connect to the Edge Server:

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Configure the Server Connection

      In the Swift template app's :file:`atlasConfig`, set the values to:

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1

         * - Key
           - Value

         * - ``baseUrl``
           - The public-accessible DNS of your Edge Server's host. 
             This is ``http://`` followed by the same value you set in your 
             Edge Server config's ``hostname`` field.
          
         * - ``appId``
           - The App ID of your App Services App that has Edge Server 
             enabled. For more information about finding the App ID, refer 
             to :ref:`find-app-id`.

   .. step:: Adjust the App Transport Security Settings

      For iOS, Apple disables insecure connections by default. You must add
      an exception for your public-accessible DNS to allow the client app 
      to connect to it.

      Select your App target, and go to the :guilabel:`Signing & Capabilities`
      tab. Press the :guilabel:`+ Capability` button, and search for 
      ``App Transport Security Settings``. Add this to your app.

      Add an exception domain for your public-accessible DNS. This should
      be just the string domain, similar to: ``ec2-13-58-70-88.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com``.

      This creates an :file:`Info.plist` file in your project. Go to this file
      to make the following adjustments.

      Change this ``String`` key to a ``Dictionary``. Add two more keys for:

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1

         * - Key
           - Type
           - Value

         * - ``NSIncludesSubdomains``
           - Boolean
           - ``YES``
          
         * - ``NSExceptionAllowsInsecureHTTPLoads``
           - Boolean
           - ``YES``

      This enables your iOS client to connect to the insecure HTTP DNS.

      Your :file:`Info.plist` file should look similar to:

      .. image:: /images/tiered-sync-info-plist.png
         :alt: Screenshot of an Info.plist file showing the settings above

   .. step:: Adjust the Log Level (Optional)

      You can adjust the log level if you'd like to get additional details 
      about the status of communication with the Edge Server.

      In the :file:`App` file, you can add an ``.onAppear`` block to set 
      the log level. Add a log level line in this block to get additional 
      information:

      .. code-block:: swift
         :emphasize-lines: 10-12

         var body: some Scene {
            WindowGroup {
               ContentView(app: app)
                  .environmentObject(errorHandler)
                  .alert(Text("Error"), isPresented: .constant(errorHandler.error != nil)) {
                     Button("OK", role: .cancel) { errorHandler.error = nil }
                  } message: {
                     Text(errorHandler.error?.localizedDescription ?? "")
                  }
                  .onAppear {
                     Logger.shared.level = .trace
                  }
            }
         }

      For more information about setting the log level, refer to 
      :ref:`swift-logging`.

   .. step:: Run the App

      Now you can build and run the app. When you log in, the app connects 
      to the Edge Server. When you create new Items, those sync with the 
      Edge Server. The Edge Server then syncs with the Atlas App Services App.

      You can check the status of the Edge Server from your host.
      With the client running, you can see ``"num_local_clients": 1`` in 
      the Edge Server status. You can also see error messages reflected
      in the sync status.

      After the next time the Edge Server syncs with your App Services App,
      you can see synced changes reflected in the linked Atlas collection.

      .. important::

         If you have previously connected directly from the client to your 
         App Services App with Device Sync, you may need to clear state on the 
         simulator or device. Resetting your cache enables your client to 
         connect to the Edge Server.

         In a console app, delete the ``mongodb-realm`` directory. If you're
         using an iOS or Android simulator or device, uninstall and reinstall
         the app.
