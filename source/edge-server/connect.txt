Once the Edge Server is :ref:`configured <edge-server-configure>` and 
:ref:`running <start-and-stop-edge-server>`, you can connect to it from 
a client application.

There are two ways you can connect to the Edge Server from a client:

- Using the Device SDKs
- Using MongoDB Drivers and tools

When you connect to Edge Server using a Device SDK, Device Sync automatically
synchronizes data across devices and with the Edge Server. If you connect
to Edge Server using MongoDB Drivers or tools, you can perform CRUD operations 
with a subset of supported MongoDB APIs.

.. _edge-server-connect-from-client:

Connect to the Edge Server from the Device SDK
----------------------------------------------

To connect to the Edge Server from a Device SDK client, your app must:

- Set the Sync URL on the App configuration to the public-accessible DNS 
  address you set in the Edge Server :file:`edge_config.json` ``baseURL`` 
  field.
- If TLS is not enabled, use HTTP over port 80.

.. tip::

   While your Edge Server deployment is in development, we recommend connecting
   with HTTP over port 80 for simplicity. Before moving to production, 
   you can coordinate with your Product or Account Representative to configure
   HTTPS with a self-signed certificate.

For information about customizing the App configuration, refer to the 
documentation for your preferred SDK:

- C++ SDK: :ref:`cpp-connect-to-backend`
- Flutter SDK: :ref:`flutter-connect-to-backend`
- Java SDK: :ref:`java-init-appclient`
- Kotlin SDK: :ref:`kotlin-connect-to-backend`
- .NET SDK: :ref:`dotnet-init-appclient`
- Node.js SDK: :ref:`node-connect-to-mongodb-realm-backend-app`
- React Native SDK: :ref:`react-native-connect-to-mongodb-realm-backend-app`
- Swift SDK: :ref:`ios-init-appclient`

.. _edge-server-device-sdk-roaming:

Roaming Between Edge Servers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SDK clients can roam between Edge Servers, or between an Edge Server and Atlas.

Roaming requires changing the base URL in the client's App configuration.
For details, refer to the SDK documentation linked above.

Roaming Users and Anonymous Authentication
``````````````````````````````````````````

When roaming between Edge Servers or an Edge Server and Atlas, anonymous users
do not persist across servers. Atlas creates a new anonymous user for each 
server the client connects to, and does not persist local data across servers.

For all other supported authentication providers, users persist and have 
access to the expected data across servers.

Example: SwiftUI Template App
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For a quick proof of concept using a template app, these are the 
modifications you can make to the :github:`Swift template app 
<mongodb/template-app-swiftui-todo>` to connect to the Edge Server:

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Configure the Server Connection

      In the Swift template app's :file:`atlasConfig`, set the values to:

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1

         * - Key
           - Value

         * - ``baseUrl``
           - The public-accessible DNS of your Edge Server's host.
             This is ``http://``, or if TLS is enabled, ``https://``, 
             followed by the same value you set in your Edge Server 
             :file:`edge_config.json` ``baseURL`` field.
          
         * - ``appId``
           - The App ID of your App Services App that has Edge Server 
             enabled. For more information about finding the App ID, refer 
             to :ref:`find-app-id`.

   .. step:: Adjust the App Transport Security Settings (Optional)

      If your app uses TLS, you can disregard this step. If you are developing
      an Edge Server app with TLS not enabled during development, you must 
      complete this step.

      For iOS, Apple disables insecure connections by default. You must add
      an exception for your public-accessible DNS to allow the client app 
      to connect to it.

      Select your App target, and go to the :guilabel:`Signing & Capabilities`
      tab. Press the :guilabel:`+ Capability` button, and search for 
      ``App Transport Security Settings``. Add this to your app.

      Add an exception domain for your public-accessible DNS. This should
      be just the string domain, similar to: ``ec2-13-58-70-88.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com``.

      This creates an :file:`Info.plist` file in your project. Go to this file
      to make the following adjustments.

      Change this ``String`` key to a ``Dictionary``. Add two more keys for:

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1

         * - Key
           - Type
           - Value

         * - ``NSIncludesSubdomains``
           - Boolean
           - ``YES``
          
         * - ``NSExceptionAllowsInsecureHTTPLoads``
           - Boolean
           - ``YES``

      This enables your iOS client to connect to the insecure HTTP DNS.

      Your :file:`Info.plist` file should look similar to:

      .. image:: /images/tiered-sync-info-plist.png
         :alt: Screenshot of an Info.plist file showing the settings above

   .. step:: Adjust the Log Level (Optional)

      You can adjust the log level if you'd like to get additional details 
      about the status of communication with the Edge Server.

      In the :file:`App` file, you can add an ``.onAppear`` block to set 
      the log level. Add a log level line in this block to get additional 
      information:

      .. code-block:: swift
         :emphasize-lines: 10-12

         var body: some Scene {
            WindowGroup {
               ContentView(app: app)
                  .environmentObject(errorHandler)
                  .alert(Text("Error"), isPresented: .constant(errorHandler.error != nil)) {
                     Button("OK", role: .cancel) { errorHandler.error = nil }
                  } message: {
                     Text(errorHandler.error?.localizedDescription ?? "")
                  }
                  .onAppear {
                     Logger.shared.level = .trace
                  }
            }
         }

      For more information about setting the log level, refer to 
      :ref:`swift-logging`.

   .. step:: Run the App

      Now you can build and run the app. When you log in, the app connects 
      to the Edge Server. When you create new Items, those sync with the 
      Edge Server. The Edge Server then syncs with the Atlas App Services App.

      You can check the status of the Edge Server from your host.
      With the client running, you can see ``"num_local_clients": 1`` in 
      the Edge Server status. You can also see error messages reflected
      in the sync status.

      After the next time the Edge Server syncs with your App Services App,
      you can see synced changes reflected in the linked Atlas collection.

      .. important::

         If you have previously connected directly from the client to your 
         App Services App with Device Sync, you may need to clear state on the 
         simulator or device. Resetting your cache enables your client to 
         connect to the Edge Server.

         In a console app, delete the ``mongodb-realm`` directory. If you're
         using an iOS or Android simulator or device, uninstall and reinstall
         the app.

.. _edge-server-wireprotocol-connect:

Connect to the Edge Server with a MongoDB URI
---------------------------------------------

You can connect to the Edge Server using standard MongoDB Drivers and tools.
Clients use a specialized MongoDB URI connection string to connect to 
Edge Server and send requests.

The wire protocol server is on by default. You can connect to it via the 
host machine using this MongoDB URI:

.. code:: console

   mongodb://<username>:<password>@<hostname>:<port>?authMechanism=PLAIN&appName=::<auth-type>

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Element
     - Description

   * - ``<username>``
     - The username of the Atlas user. For an 
       :ref:`email/password user <email-password-authentication>`, this 
       might look similar to ``first.last@example.com``.

   * - ``<password>``
     - The password of the Atlas user. This might look similar to 
       ``myPassword123456``.

   * - ``<hostname>``
     - The public DNS of your Edge Server host. While in local development, 
       this might be ``localhost``. Otherwise, it might look similar to
       ``ec2-13-58-70-88.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com``. For more 
       information, refer to :ref:`edge-server-install-and-configure`.

   * - ``<port>``
     - The Edge Server wireprotocol listen port. The default port is ``27021``.
       For more details, refer to :ref:`edge-server-install-and-configure`.

   * - ``authMechanism=PLAIN``
     - The auth mechanism. Currently, the only supported value is ``PLAIN``.

   * - ``appName``
     - Optional string ``appName``. You may omit the value and/or key.

   * - ``<auth-type>``
     - The type of authentication provider. For example, ``local-userpass`` 
       for email/password authentication. Currently, the only supported type
       is ``local-userpass``.

.. example::

   A wire protocol connection URI for an Edge Server hosted on Amazon EC2 
   might look similar to:

   .. code:: console

      mongodb://example-user:my-password@ec2-13-58-70-88.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:27021?authMechanism=PLAIN&appName=::local-userpass

Edge Server currently supports a subset of the MongoDB APIs. For information 
about the supported APIs, refer to :ref:`edge-server-mongodb`.

.. _edge-server-compass-connect:

Connect to the Edge Server with Compass
---------------------------------------

You can connect to the Edge Server using :ref:`MongoDB Compass <compass-index>`.
Compass enables you to explore the documents syncing to Edge Server, and 
make updates to those documents.

Connect with Compass
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[PLACEHOLDER - not sure exactly what URI to use to connect with Compass - 
complete this with info from engineering or after we can test this ourselves]

Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~

The Edge Server support for Compass is limited. You can use it to:

- Browse databases, collections, and documents in the Edge Server
- Perform basic CRUD operations on documents in the Edge Server

Edge Server does not support aggregation with Compass at this time.
