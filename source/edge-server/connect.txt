Once the Edge Server instance is :ref:`configured <edge-server-configure>` and 
:ref:`running <start-and-stop-edge-server>`, you can connect to it from 
a client application.

There are three ways you can connect to the Edge Server instance from a client:

- Atlas Device SDK: Device Sync automatically synchronizes data across devices 
  and with the Edge Server.
- MongoDB Drivers and tools: Perform CRUD operations with a subset of supported 
  MongoDB APIs.
- MongoDB Compass: Explore documents syncing to Edge Server instance, and make 
  updates to those documents.

.. _edge-server-connect-from-client:

Connect to the Edge Server from Atlas Device SDK
------------------------------------------------

To connect to the Edge Server instance from an Atlas Device SDK client, your 
app must:

- Set the Sync URL on the App configuration to the public-accessible DNS 
  address you set in the Edge Server :file:`edge_config.json` ``baseURL`` 
  field.
- If TLS is not enabled, use HTTP over port 80.

.. tip::

   While your Edge Server deployment is in development, we recommend connecting
   with HTTP over port 80 for simplicity. Before moving to production, 
   you can coordinate with your Product or Account Representative to configure
   HTTPS with a self-signed certificate.

For information about customizing the App configuration, refer to the 
documentation for your preferred SDK:

- C++ SDK: :ref:`cpp-connect-to-backend`
- Flutter SDK: :ref:`flutter-connect-to-backend`
- Java SDK: :ref:`java-init-appclient`
- Kotlin SDK: :ref:`kotlin-connect-to-backend`
- .NET SDK: :ref:`dotnet-init-appclient`
- Node.js SDK: :ref:`node-connect-to-mongodb-realm-backend-app`
- React Native SDK: :ref:`react-native-connect-to-mongodb-realm-backend-app`
- Swift SDK: :ref:`ios-init-appclient`

Supported Authentication Providers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Edge Server currently supports a subset of authentication providers when
connecting with an SDK:

- :ref:`anonymous-authentication`
- :ref:`email-password-authentication`
- :ref:`api-key-authentication`
- :ref:`custom-function-authentication`

.. _edge-server-device-sdk-roaming:

Roaming Between Edge Servers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SDK clients can roam between Edge Server instances, or between an Edge Server
instance and Atlas.

Roaming requires changing the base URL in the client's App configuration.
For details, refer to the SDK documentation linked above.

Roaming Users and Anonymous Authentication
``````````````````````````````````````````

When roaming between Edge Server instances or an Edge Server instance and 
Atlas, anonymous users do not persist across servers. Atlas creates a new 
anonymous user for each server the client connects to, and does not persist 
local data across servers.

For all other supported authentication providers, users persist and have 
access to the expected data across servers.

When an SDK user roams, the client app must perform a client reset upon
connecting to the new server. For more information about client resets, refer 
to :ref:`client-resets`.

Example: SwiftUI Template App
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For a quick proof of concept using a template app, these are the 
modifications you can make to the :github:`Swift template app 
<mongodb/template-app-swiftui-todo>` to connect to the Edge Server instance:

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Configure the Server Connection

      In the Swift template app's :file:`atlasConfig`, set the values to:

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1

         * - Key
           - Value

         * - ``baseUrl``
           - The public-accessible DNS of your Edge Server instance host.
             This is ``http://``, or if TLS is enabled, ``https://``, 
             followed by the IP address exposed in your Edge Server
             container configuration.
          
         * - ``appId``
           - The App ID of your App Services App that has Edge Server 
             enabled. For more information about finding the App ID, refer 
             to :ref:`find-app-id`.

   .. step:: Adjust the App Transport Security Settings (Optional)

      If your app uses TLS, you can disregard this step. If you are developing
      an Edge Server app with TLS not enabled during development, you must 
      complete this step.

      For iOS, Apple disables insecure connections by default. You must add
      an exception for your public-accessible DNS to allow the client app 
      to connect to it.

      Select your App target, and go to the :guilabel:`Signing & Capabilities`
      tab. Press the :guilabel:`+ Capability` button, and search for 
      ``App Transport Security Settings``. Add this to your app.

      Add an exception domain for your public-accessible DNS. This should
      be just the string domain, similar to: ``ec2-13-58-70-88.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com``.

      This creates an :file:`Info.plist` file in your project. Go to this file
      to make the following adjustments.

      Change this ``String`` key to a ``Dictionary``. Add two more keys for:

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1

         * - Key
           - Type
           - Value

         * - ``NSIncludesSubdomains``
           - Boolean
           - ``YES``
          
         * - ``NSExceptionAllowsInsecureHTTPLoads``
           - Boolean
           - ``YES``

      This enables your iOS client to connect to the insecure HTTP DNS.

      Your :file:`Info.plist` file should look similar to:

      .. image:: /images/tiered-sync-info-plist.png
         :alt: Screenshot of an Info.plist file showing the settings above

   .. step:: Adjust the Log Level (Optional)

      You can adjust the log level if you'd like to get additional details 
      about the status of communication with the Edge Server.

      In the :file:`App` file, you can add an ``.onAppear`` block to set 
      the log level. Add a log level line in this block to get additional 
      information:

      .. code-block:: swift
         :emphasize-lines: 10-12

         var body: some Scene {
            WindowGroup {
               ContentView(app: app)
                  .environmentObject(errorHandler)
                  .alert(Text("Error"), isPresented: .constant(errorHandler.error != nil)) {
                     Button("OK", role: .cancel) { errorHandler.error = nil }
                  } message: {
                     Text(errorHandler.error?.localizedDescription ?? "")
                  }
                  .onAppear {
                     Logger.shared.level = .trace
                  }
            }
         }

      For more information about setting the log level, refer to 
      :ref:`swift-logging`.

   .. step:: Run the App

      Now you can build and run the app. When you log in, the app connects 
      to the Edge Server instance. When you create new Items, those sync with 
      the instance. The instance then syncs with the Atlas App Services App.

      You can check the status of the Edge Server instance from your host.
      With the client running, you can see ``"num_local_clients": 1`` in 
      the instance status. You can also see error messages reflected
      in the sync status.

      After the next time the Edge Server instance syncs with your App Services 
      App, you can see synced changes reflected in the linked Atlas collection.

      .. important::

         If you have previously connected directly from the client to your 
         App Services App with Device Sync, you may need to clear state on the 
         simulator or device. Resetting your cache enables your client to 
         connect to the Edge Server instance.

         In a console app, delete the ``mongodb-realm`` directory. If you're
         using an iOS or Android simulator or device, uninstall and reinstall
         the app.

.. _edge-server-wireprotocol-connect:

Connect to the Edge Server with MongoDB Drivers and Tools
---------------------------------------------------------

You can connect to the Edge Server using standard MongoDB Drivers and tools.
Clients use a specialized MongoDB URI connection string to connect to 
Edge Server and send requests.

The Wire Protocol server accepts these incoming connections, and is on by 
default. You can connect to the host machine with a MongoDB URI.

This URI may vary depending on the authentication type. Broadly, it resembles
this form:

.. code:: console

   mongodb://<username>:<password>@<hostname>:<port>?authMechanism=PLAIN

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Element
     - Description

   * - ``<username>``
     - The username of the Atlas user. For an 
       :ref:`email/password user <email-password-authentication>`, this 
       might look similar to ``first.last@example.com``. If this username
       contains an ``@`` symbol, you must escape the ``@`` symbol. For example,
       ``john.doe@example.com`` becomes ``john.doe%40example.com``.

   * - ``<password>``
     - The password of the Atlas user. This might look similar to 
       ``myPassword123456``.

   * - ``<hostname>``
     - The public DNS of your Edge Server host. While in local development, 
       this might be ``localhost``. Otherwise, it might look similar to
       ``ec2-13-58-70-88.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com``. For more 
       information, refer to :ref:`edge-server-install-and-configure`.

   * - ``<port>``
     - The Edge Server Wire Protocol listen port. The default port is ``27021``.
       For more details, refer to :ref:`edge-server-install-and-configure`.

   * - ``authMechanism=PLAIN``
     - The auth mechanism. Currently, the only supported value is ``PLAIN``.

.. example::

   A Wire Protocol connection URI for an Edge Server instance hosted on Amazon 
   EC2 might look similar to:

   .. code:: console

      mongodb://example-user:my-password@ec2-13-58-70-88.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:27021?authMechanism=PLAIN

.. _anonymous-connection-URI:

Anonymous Connections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can enable anonymous connections and connect without specifying a username 
or password. This option is disabled by default.

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Configure Edge Server with the Relevant Flag

      To enable anonymous connections, start the Edge Server with the
      ``--insecure-disable-auth`` flag set to ``true``. This allows you to
      connect without specifying a username and password.

      This setting is ``false`` by default. Setting this to ``true`` enables
      connections to bypass authentication.

      For more information about using ``edgectl`` to configure and start
      the Edge Server instance, refer to 
      :ref:`edge-server-install-and-configure`.

   .. step:: Omit Authentication Details from MongoDB URI

      When connecting without authentication, the MongoDB URI omits the 
      authentication-related parameters. This simplfied URI is:

      .. code:: console

         mongodb://<hostname>:<port>

      .. example::

         An anonymous Wire Protocol connection URI for an Edge Server instance 
         hosted on Amazon EC2 might look similar to:

         .. code:: console

            mongodb://ec2-13-58-70-88.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:27021
        
         An anonymous connection to an Edge Server instance running on your
         machine during development may resemble:

         .. code:: console

            mongodb://localhost:27021

Supported Authentication Providers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Edge Server currently supports a subset of authentication providers when
connecting over the Wire Protocol:

- :ref:`anonymous-authentication`
- :ref:`email-password-authentication`

Supported MongoDB APIs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Edge Server currently supports a subset of the MongoDB APIs. For information 
about the supported APIs, refer to :ref:`edge-server-mongodb`.

.. _edge-server-compass-connect:

Connect with MongoDB Compass
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can connect to the Edge Server instance using the MongoDB URI through 
:ref:`MongoDB Compass <compass-index>`. Compass enables you to explore the 
documents syncing to Edge Server instance, and make updates to those documents.

Limitations
```````````

Edge Server support for Compass is limited. You can use it to:

- Browse databases, collections, and documents in the Edge Server instance.
- Perform basic CRUD operations on documents in the Edge Server instance.

Edge Server does not support aggregation with Compass at this time.
