Atlas Edge Server natively implements a subset of the MongoDB wire protocol,
which allows you to access your Atlas data on the Edge using standard
MongoDB drivers and tools. 

Clients use a specialized MongoDB URI connection string to connect and 
send requests. For more information about how to connect to the Edge Server
using a MongoDB connection string, refer to :ref:`edge-server-wireprotocol-connect`.

Edge Server currently supports a subset of the MongoDB APIs over the 
wire protocol.

CRUD APIs
---------

Edge Server currently supports using these MongoDB CRUD APIs over the 
wire protocol.

For examples of using these commands, refer to the documentation for the
Driver or tool you're using to execute these commands.

Read
~~~~

Read operations take a query filter and find all documents in a collection 
that match the filter. 

- You can find a single document using the ``collection.findOne()`` method.
- You can find multiple documents using the ``collection.find()`` method.

Insert
~~~~~~

Insert operations take one or more documents and add them to a MongoDB 
collection.

- You can insert a document or documents into a collection using the 
  ``collection.insert()`` method.
- You can insert a single document using the
  ``collection.insertOne()`` method.
- You can insert multiple documents at the same time using the
  ``collection.insertMany()`` method.

Update
~~~~~~

Update operations find existing documents in a MongoDB collection and
modify their data. You use standard MongoDB query syntax to specify
which documents to update and :manual:`update operators
</reference/operator/update>` to describe the changes to apply to
matching documents.

- You can update a document or documents in a collection using the 
  ``collection.update()`` method.
- You can update a single document using the
  ``collection.updateOne()`` method.
- You can update multiple documents in a collection using the
  ``collection.updateMany()`` method.
- You can find and update one or more documents in a collection using the
  ``collection.findAndModify()`` method. This action allows you to atomically 
  find, modify, and return one or more documents with the same command. This 
  avoids the risk of other update operations changing the documents between 
  separate find and update operations.

.. note:: 

   Edge Server does not currently support ``upsert``.

Delete
~~~~~~

Delete operations find existing documents in a MongoDB collection and
remove them. You use standard MongoDB query syntax to specify which
documents to delete.

- You can delete a single document from a collection using the
  ``collection.deleteOne()`` method.
- You can delete multiple items from a collection using the
  ``collection.deleteMany()`` method.
