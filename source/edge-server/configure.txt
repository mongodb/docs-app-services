After you create an Edge Server instance in Atlas, you must configure the 
hardware that runs the Edge Server instance. For most use cases, you'll 
provision hardware on-premises to host the Edge Server instance. While you're 
developing your Edge Server application, you may host it on a cloud server 
for convenience.

Client devices on-prem connect to the Edge Server instance. Your instance 
connects to the Edge Server Service or Device Sync Service, depending on
how you create it. Clients do not connect to MongoDB Atlas directly.

This page details how to configure and perform operations on the Edge Server
instance.

.. _edge-server-create-device-sync-app:

Prerequisites
-------------

Each Edge Server instance connects to a service in your Atlas project. Before 
you can use an Edge Server instance, you must create the relevant service, and 
configure an authentication provider and permissions for your Edge Server 
instance.

For more information, refer to :ref:`create-edge-server-service`.

.. _edge-server-host-requirements:

Edge Server Host Requirements
-----------------------------

The host that runs the Edge Server instance may be an EC2 instance or other cloud 
server, or hardware that you provision on-site.

.. tip::

   For proof-of-concept testing, you can launch an EC2 instance running 
   Ubuntu Server 18.x. Under Network settings, add a rule to allow access 
   via HTTP/Port 80. Free tier settings are sufficient for small PoC projects.

.. _edge-server-hardware-requirements:

Required Hardware
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The current minimum hardware requirements to run an Edge Server instance are:

- CPU: 64-bit, quad-core processor
- RAM: 8GB memory
- Storage: 32GB disk space

These requirements may change after Edge Server benchmarking is complete.

.. _edge-server-os-support:

OS Compatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Edge Server has been verified with the following operating systems:

- macOS 11.x and newer running on M1 or Intel 2018+ MacBook Pros
- Raspberry Pi OS 12
- Ubuntu Server 18+

Other operating systems may be possible, but have not yet been verified.

.. _edge-server-required-software:

Required Software
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For convenience, you can manage an Edge Server instance with Docker in Swarm 
mode during development. In production environments, use Kubernetes to manage 
your Edge Server containers.

If you do not have Docker installed and Swarm enabled, you will be prompted
to resolve these dependencies prior to running the Edge Server.

.. _edge-server-required-network-access:

Required Network Access
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To accept connections from sync clients or connections using a MongoDB URI, 
the host that runs the Edge Server must allow access to incoming connections.

If you run the Edge Server on your own infrastructure, you don't need to open
the instance to the general internet. You only need to ensure your client 
devices can access it.

For cloud infrastructure, such as running a development environment on
EC2, you must open ports to accept incoming connections:

- Development: Use HTTP on port 80 for simplicity and speed of development.
- Production: Use SSL with port 443 to secure access to production data.

Edge Server supports TLS.

We recommend setting up TLS termination for HTTP access, including Device SDK 
traffic, through a Kubernetes controller.

Connections through MongoDB URIs can configure TLS through ``edgectl``.

.. _edge-server-install-and-configure:

Install and Configure the Edge Server Instance
----------------------------------------------

After creating an Edge Server Service or Device Sync Service, you must create 
an Edge Server instance. Each service may have many Edge Server instances. When 
you create an Edge Server instance, you get an installation script you can use 
to download a tool to install and manage the Edge Server instance, ``edgectl``. 
You also get a token you can use to register the Edge Server instance. For more
details, refer to :ref:`create-edge-server-instance`.

Use the installation script to set up and run the Edge Server instance on the 
host.

.. include:: /includes/important-stop-edge-server.rst

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Install the Edge Server Code

      Edge Server uses a command-line tool called ``edgectl`` to manage
      the Edge Server instance on the host hardware. This includes an install
      script to manage the installation and install required dependencies.

      Use this command to install the command-line tool and the Edge Server 
      code on the device where you want to run the Edge Server instance:

      .. code-block:: shell

         curl -s https://services.cloud.mongodb.com/edge/install.sh | bash

      Follow the prompts to download and install the Edge Server code.

   .. step:: Initialize the Edge Server Instance

      Use ``edgectl`` to set up the Edge Server instance.

      .. code-block:: shell

         edgectl init --app-id="<INSERT-YOUR-APP-ID-HERE>" --platform=compose

      The minimum required parameters are the ``app-id`` and the ``platform``.

      - ``--app-id``: Provide your Edge Server App ID. For example, 
        ``--app-id="edge-server-vtoyh"``. For more information, refer to 
        :ref:`find-app-id`. 
      - ``--platform``: You can use Docker Compose to install and manage your
        Edge Server instance in a development environment, or Kubernetes to 
        manage the instance in a production environment. Valid values are 
        either ``compose`` or ``kubernetes``.

      You can provide the following optional flags to specify additional
      configuration details:

      .. include:: /includes/edge/edgectl-init-flags.rst

   .. step:: Supply the Edge Server Token

      When first configuring the Edge Server instance, you're prompted to 
      supply the Edge Server token. This is the token you got when you added 
      the instance to your service.

      If you no longer have the token, you can generate a new token from the
      :ref:`edge-server-details` in your service.

      The Edge Server instance exchanges this token for a secret. It uses the
      secret to authenticate with Atlas when it syncs data.

   .. step:: (Optional) Create a New User

      If you'd like to connect to the Edge Server instance using a MongoDB
      Driver or tool, you must have a username/password credential, or bypass
      authentication. If you already have a username/password credential, or 
      don't plan to connect to the Edge Server instance using a MongoDB Driver
      or tool, you can skip this step.

      For more information, refer to :ref:`edge-server-wireprotocol-connect`.

      If you don't already have a username/password credential, you can create
      one by following the prompts during ``edgectl init``.

      Otherwise, you can manually :ref:`create-email-password-user` later
      using the App Services UI, the App Services CLI, or the App Services
      Admin API.

      Alternately, if you plan to implement an authorization flow later, you
      can bypass authorization with the following command and flag:

      .. code-block:: console

         edgectl config --insecure-disable-auth

.. _start-and-stop-edge-server:

Start and Stop the Edge Server
------------------------------

Use ``edgectl`` to start and stop the Edge Server instance.

To start all Edge Server instance containers, use the ``start`` command:

.. code-block:: shell

   edgectl start

To stop all Edge Server instance containers, use the ``stop`` command:

.. code-block:: shell

   edgectl stop

.. include:: /includes/important-stop-edge-server.rst

.. _check-edge-server-status:

Check the Edge Server Status
----------------------------

.. include:: /includes/edge/edgectl-status.rst

.. _update-edge-server-instance-config:

Update the Edge Server Instance Configuration
---------------------------------------------

You can make changes to an existing Edge Server instance using ``edgectl``.
After you change the configuration, restart the instance to apply the updates.

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Update the Edge Server Configuration

      Use the ``edgectl config`` command with the appropriate flags to update
      the instance:

      .. code-block:: console

         edgectl config --YOUR-FLAG-HERE

      .. include:: includes/edge/edgectl-config-flags.rst

   .. step:: Restart the Edge Server Instance

      After you update the configuration, stop the instance:

      .. code-block:: console

         edgectl stop

      And start it again to apply the updates:

      .. code-block:: console

         edgectl start

.. _upgrade-edge-server-version:

Upgrade the Edge Server Version
-------------------------------

As the Edge Server evolves, you may want to upgrade your Edge Server 
version to take advantage of new functionality. Additionally, an Edge Server
instance must be no more than one major version behind the latest available, 
or it enters a ``FAILED`` state and cannot connect to Atlas.

.. important:: Required network access

   To upgrade the Edge Server version, ``edgectl`` must have network
   access. You cannot upgrade the Edge Server version if ``edgectl`` is not 
   online.

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Run the Upgrade Command

      You can upgrade the Edge Server version using ``edgectl``:

      .. code-block:: shell

         edgectl update

      Depending on your hardware and network connection, the upgrade 
      process may take seconds to minutes.

      You can optionally specify arguments to upgrade to a specific version:

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1
         :widths: 20 10 70

         * - Field name
           - Type
           - Value

         * - ``--config-path``
           - String
           - The location on disk to store configuration files. Defaults to
             ``~/.mongodb-edge/``.

         * - ``--minor``
           - Boolean
           - Upgrade to the latest minor version for your current major version.
             Defaults to ``true``.

         * - ``--major``
           - Boolean
           - Upgrade to the next major version. Defaults to ``false``.

         * - ``--to``
           - String
           - Upgrade (or downgrade) to an exact version. Default ``""``.

   .. step:: Configure the Edge Server

      After upgrading, ``edgectl`` prompts you to update the configuration.

      .. code-block:: shell

         edgectl config
   
   .. step:: Run the Edge Server to Deploy Changes

      After upgrading, run the Edge Server to deploy the updates.

      .. code-block:: shell

         edgectl start

   .. step:: (Optional) Reset the Edge Server

      If you encounter unexpected behavior after upgrading the Edge Server,
      you may want to reset it and start it again. Run the following 
      command:

      .. code-block::

         edgectl clean

      Then, run the Edge Server again.

      .. code-block::

         edgectl start

   .. step:: Remove Unneeded Files

      After upgrading, you can remove any files that are no longer needed.

      .. code-block::

         edgectl prune

.. _edge-server-cycle-api-key:

Cycle the Edge Server API Key
-----------------------------

To cycle the Edge Server API key:

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Generate a New Token in Atlas

      You can generate a new Edge Server token from the 
      :ref:`edge-server-details`. Use the :guilabel:`Regenerate Token`
      button to get a new token, and copy it. You won't be able to see this
      token again, and must generate a new token if you do not copy it.

   .. step:: Supply the New Edge Server Token

      Use ``edgectl`` to be prompted for a new token from the Edge Server 
      instance:

      .. code-block:: shell

         edgectl config --update-registration-token

      This triggers ``edgectl`` to prompt you for the token. When you provide 
      it, the Edge Server instance exchanges this token for a secret. It uses 
      the secret to authenticate with Atlas when it syncs data.

      .. important:: Required network access

         To exchange the token for an API key, ``edgectl`` must have network
         access. You cannot cycle the API key if ``edgectl`` is not online.

.. _specify-edge-server-query:

Specify the Edge Server's Query
-------------------------------

If you don't specify a query, an Edge Server instance defaults to a global 
query of ``"*"``, which automatically syncs all data in all of the collections
in your linked data source.

You can use a few arguments with the ``edgectl config`` command
to specify the Edge Server instance Sync query:

- Pass a simple string query:

  .. code-block:: console

     edgectl config --query="Store: store_id == 42"

- Pass multiple query flags to supply queries for multiple collections:

  .. code-block:: console

     edgectl config --query="Person: age > 10" --query "Pet: type = 'cat'"

- Pass a path to a file containing a JSON object mapping more complex queries:

  .. code-block:: console

     edgectl config --query-file="/Users/my.user/edge-server/query.json"

- Pass a global query to use the same query for all collections:

  .. code-block:: console

     edgectl config --global-query="shouldSync == true"

Unless you're using a global query, Edge Server queries take the form of 
``YOUR-SCHEMA-TITLE: YOUR-QUERY``:

- ``YOUR-SCHEMA-TITLE``: The ``title`` field of a :ref:`schema <schemas>`, 
  which typically matches the name of a collection in your database. In the 
  event of two collections with identical names in different databases, we 
  prepend the collection name with the database name; for example,
  ``databaseName_collectionName``.
  
  Your linked Atlas data source may contain many collections, each with a 
  matching schema. If you do not use the default Edge Server query ``"*"`` or 
  a global query that syncs everything, each schema that you want to sync must
  have its own query. 
  
  If you're using a template app, this is the ``Item`` collection.

- ``YOUR-QUERY``: The query that determines which documents the Edge 
  Server can sync with a collection. You can use :ref:`Realm Query Language <rql>` 
  to define this query, with the same caveats around :ref:`Flexible Sync RQL 
  Limitations <flexible-sync-rql-limitations>`.

.. note:: Queryable Fields

   Because Edge Servers use Device Sync to sync data with Atlas, the query you
   use on the Edge Server instance must use a **queryable field**. If you use
   an Edge Server Service, we automatically add fields that you use in Edge
   Server instance queries to the queryable fields. If you use a Device Sync
   Service with Edge Servers, we only add queryable fields when Development
   Mode is enabled.

   For more information, refer to :ref:`queryable-fields`.

.. _edge-server-query-examples:

Edge Server Query Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sync All Documents
```````````````````

You can sync all documents between Edge Server instance and Atlas. This uses 
the ``truepredicate`` or ``"*"`` query. Because this is a global query, you 
can pass it as a string with the ``edgectl --global-query`` argument.

If you do not provide a query when you configure your Edge Server instance,
this is the default query.

.. code-block:: shell

   edgectl config --global-query="truepredicate"

Sync a Subset of Documents from All Collections
```````````````````````````````````````````````

You might only want to sync a subset of documents with an Edge Server instance.
For example, for an instance located in a specific store, you might want to
sync only the documents relevant to that store. An RQL query for that might
look similar to:

.. code-block:: shell

   edgectl config --global-query="store_id == 42"

Sync a Subset of Documents from One Collection
``````````````````````````````````````````````

If the data source linked to your Edge Server-compatible service contains more
than one collection, and you want to define a query for a specific collection,
you can provide a mapping of the schema title for the collection, and a 
relevant query. 

In this example, we set a query for the ``Inventory`` collection, whose schema 
title is also ``Inventory``. The Edge Server instance only syncs documents from
that collection where ``store_id`` matches ``42``, which is the store number 
where the Edge Server instance is located.

.. code-block:: console

   edgectl config --query="Inventory: store_id == 42"

The linked data source also contains a ``Customers`` collection. But since
there is no query from the Edge Server instance for that collection, none of 
the documents in the collection sync to the Edge Server instance - even if
they contain a ``store_id`` field whose value matches the ``42`` from the
Edge Server query.

Specify Different Queries for Multiple Collections
``````````````````````````````````````````````````

For a more complex query, where you want to pass different queries for 
multiple collections, you have two options:

- Pass multiple ``--query`` flags, one for each collection
- Pass a path to a file where you define the queries as JSON

In these examples, we have three collections: ``Project``, ``Item``, and 
``Team``, whose collection names match their schema titles. These queries sync 
data with two of the collections: ``Item`` and ``Project``. The 
``Project`` collection has a list property that represents a 
:ref:`to-many relationship <relationships-to-many>` to the ``Item`` 
collection. We don't want to sync the ``Team`` collection to the Edge Server 
instance. By omitting this schema title from the queries, we don't sync any of 
its data to the instance.

With these queries, we are only syncing ``Project`` documents for facility 42. 
Additionally, we are only syncing ``Item`` documents where the ``priority`` 
field's value is greater than or equal to ``3``. In this way, you can combine 
queries to sync only the documents that are relevant to a given Edge Server 
instance.

Pass Multiple Query Flags
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

You can pass multiple query flags with ``edgectl config`` to provide queries
for multiple collections.

.. code-block:: console

   edgectl config --query="Project: facility_id == 42" --query "Item: priority >= 3"

Pass Queries as a JSON File
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

You can pass a path to a JSON file that defines many different queries. For
example:

.. code-block:: console

   edgectl config --query-file="/Users/my.user/edge-server/query.json"

Where the JSON file contains:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "Project": "facility_id == 42",
     "Item": "priority >= 3"
   }

.. _multiple-edge-servers-on-host:

Run Multiple Edge Server Instances on a Host
--------------------------------------------

While your Edge Server architecture is in development, you may want to run
multiple Edge Server instances on a single host - for example, your local
machine. You can do this using the ``edgectl`` profile functionality.

When you create an Edge Server instance, ``edgectl`` automatically creates
a default profile for you. You never have to specify the profile while there
is only one profile.

You can view the profiles, and their associated configuration files, in:

.. code-block:: console

   ~/.mongodb-edge/profiles/

If you try to create a second Edge Server instance on the same machine, you
can use the ``--profile`` flag with each command you issue. This maps the 
command to a specific Edge Server instance. If you do not supply a 
``--profile`` when issuing commands, ``edgectl`` uses the default profile.

.. code-block:: console

   edgectl start --profile=instance1 

You can name the profile with the ``--profile`` flag when you issue the 
``edgectl init`` command:

.. code-block:: console

   edgectl init --profile=instance1
