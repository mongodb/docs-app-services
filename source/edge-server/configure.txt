Edge Server is a "local" server that sits between your client devices and 
MongoDB Atlas App Services. For most use cases, you'll provision hardware 
on-premises to host the Edge Server. While you're developing your Edge 
Server application, you may host it on a cloud server for convenience.

Client devices on-prem connect to Edge Server. Your Edge Server connects 
to App Services. Clients do not connect to App Services directly.

This page details how to configure and start the Edge Server.

.. _edge-server-create-device-sync-app:

Prerequisites
-------------

Edge Server connects to a Device Sync-enabled App Services App. Before
you can use Edge Server, you must create an App Services App, enable
Device Sync, and configure an authentication provider and permissions
for your App.

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Create an App Services App

      Create an :ref:`App Services App using the UI, CLI, or Admin API <create-app>`.
      
      .. tip:: Get started quickly with a template app

         You can use an Edge Server with any Flexible Sync-enabled 
         App Services App. For a quick proof-of-concept, you can 
         :ref:`create an app from a template <create-template-app>`. 
         Any of the starter templates whose name includes 
         :guilabel:`Atlas Device Sync Starter` can quick-start your 
         Edge Server proof-of-concept. If you create a template app from 
         the Atlas UI, choose :guilabel:`Real-time Sync`.
         
         These templates set up a Device Sync-enabled task tracker app with a 
         downloadable front-end client. The template app comes pre-configured 
         with permissions for the user to write their own Items to an ``Item`` 
         collection in a ``todo`` database. It also has 
         :ref:`Development Mode <development-mode>` and 
         :ref:`email/password authentication <email-password-authentication>` 
         enabled.

         On the :ref:`edge-server-connect` page, you can learn how to 
         modify the client to connect to the Edge Server.

   .. step:: Enable Device Sync

      If you have not started with a template app, :ref:`enable Device Sync 
      <enable-sync>` with Flexible Sync. 
      
   .. step:: Configure Data Access Permissions

      Configure any :ref:`permissions <device-sync-compatibility>` your 
      App needs to enforce data access rules.

   .. step:: Configure an Authentication Provider

      Edge Server supports these authentication providers:

      - :ref:`Anonymous Authentication <anonymous-authentication>`
      - :ref:`Email/Password Authentication <email-password-authentication>`
      - :ref:`Custom JWT Authentication <custom-jwt-authentication>`
      - :ref:`API Key Authentication <api-key-authentication>`

      Enable an authentication provider for clients to connect to the Edge Server.

      .. note::
         
         If you created a :ref:`template app <template-apps>`, email/password 
         authentication is already enabled in the template app configuration.

   .. step:: Get Edge Server Enabled

      At this time, Edge Server is in Private Preview. Your MongoDB 
      representative must enable Edge Server for your App. Give
      your :ref:`App Services App ID <find-app-id>` to your 
      Product or Account Representative. They will enable Edge Server and 
      generate an authorization secret for your App.

.. _edge-server-host-requirements:

Edge Server Host Requirements
-----------------------------

The host that runs Edge Server may be an EC2 instance or other cloud 
server, or hardware that you provision on-site.

.. tip::

   For proof-of-concept testing, you can launch an EC2 instance running 
   Ubuntu Server 18.x. Under Network settings, add a rule to allow access 
   via HTTP/Port 80. Free tier settings are sufficient for small PoC projects.

.. _edge-server-required-network-access:

Required Network Access
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The host that runs the Edge Server must allow access to port 80 via HTTP 
to the general internet. 

.. _edge-server-os-support:

OS Compatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Edge Server has been verified with the following operating systems:

- Ubuntu Server 18+
- macOS 11.x and newer running on M1 or Intel 2018+ MacBook Pros

Other operating systems may be possible, but have not yet been verified.

.. _edge-server-hardware-requirements:

Hardware Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Edge Server benchmarking is not yet complete, so minimum required hardware
is not yet available. 

.. _edge-server-install-and-configure:

Install and Configure the Edge Server
-------------------------------------

Set up and run the Edge Server on the host.

.. include:: /includes/important-stop-tiered-sync-server.rst

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Get the Edge Server Code

      Use ``wget`` to get the current Edge Server code as a ``.tar`` file:

      .. code-block:: shell

         wget --content-disposition https://realm.mongodb.com/api/client/v2.0/tiered-sync/package/latest

      Unzip the tar to get the files.

      .. code-block:: shell

         tar -xvf *.tgz

      You now have an ``edge_server`` directory containing the server files.

   .. step:: Complete the Edge Server Configuration Details

      The ``edge_server`` directory contains a :file:`config.json` file you 
      must edit with the appropriate values to configure the server.

      .. code-block:: json

         {
           "clientAppId": "YOUR-APP-ID",
           "query": "*",
           "cloudSyncServerAuthSecret": "YOUR-AUTH-SECRET",
           "hostname": "YOUR-EDGE-SERVER-DOMAIN",
           "tls" : {
             "enabled": false,
             "certificates": [
               {
                 "publicKeyPath": "YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH/cert.pem",
                 "privateKeyPath": "YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH/certkey.pem"
               }
             ]
           }
         }

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1

         * - Field name
           - Value

         * - ``clientAppId``
           - The unique ID of your App Services App. For information about 
             finding the App ID, refer to :ref:`find-app-id`.

         * - ``query``
           - The ``query`` field defaults to ``"*"``, which automatically 
             syncs all data in all of the collections in your :ref:`App 
             Services schema <schemas>`.
           
             If you would like to filter the data that syncs to your Edge 
             Server, pass an object containing one or more collections 
             and queries to sync a subset of your data with Edge Server.
             This may resemble:

             .. code-block:: json

                {
                  "clientAppId": "sync-template-app-zkiee",
                  "query": {
                    "YOUR-COLLECTION-NAME": "YOUR-QUERY",
                    "YOUR-COLLECTION-NAME": "YOUR-QUERY"
                  },
                  ... additional configuration fields...
                }

         * - ``YOUR-COLLECTION-NAME``
           - If you're passing a query object to filter the data that syncs
             to the Edge Server, this is the name of a collection in your 
             database. If you're using a template app, this is the ``Item`` 
             collection. Your Edge Server query may contain many collections.
            
         * - ``YOUR-QUERY``
           - If you're passing a query object to filter the data that syncs
             to the Edge Server, this is the query that determines what 
             documents the Edge Server can sync with a collection. You can 
             use :ref:`Realm Query Language <rql>` to define this query, 
             with the same caveats around :ref:`Flexible Sync RQL 
             Limitations <flexible-sync-rql-limitations>`.
             
             For example, ``truepredicate`` means the Edge Server syncs 
             all documents with the collection. You might only want to sync 
             a subset of documents with an Edge Server, so you could pass a
             RQL query similar to ``“store_id == 42”``.

         * - ``cloudSyncServerAuthSecret``
           - The authorization secret that your Product or Account 
             Representative provided when you contacted them to get 
             Edge Server enabled for your App.

         * - ``hostname``
           - The public DNS of your host. This should resemble something
             like ``ec2-13-58-70-88.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com``. 
             For localhost, set this value to ``localhost:80``.
         
         * - ``tls``
           - A configuration object that includes the Transport Layer 
             Security options for your Edge Server. The default value is
             ``false``.

             When ``enabled`` is ``true``, Edge Server uses the TLS 
             certificates you specify in the ``certificates`` object to 
             encrypt your data. You must set the ``publicKeyPath`` and 
             ``privateKeyPath`` values to the locations of your TLS 
             certificates. When ``false``, the certificates are ignored 
             entirely, even if they point to valid certificates.

             To use TLS, you must provide certificates signed by a certificate 
             authority; for example, Let's Encrypt; or create self-signed 
             certificates and install them on the devices that connect to 
             Edge Server. During development, you may bypass certificate 
             management by disabling certificate verification in the device 
             connection code.

      .. example::

         The following example shows an Edge Server configuration file that:

         - Runs on an EC2 instance.
         - Syncs data with two collections: ``Item`` and ``Project``. 
           The ``Project`` collection has a list property that represents 
           a :ref:`to-many relationship <relationships-to-many>` to the 
           ``Item`` collection.
         - Has TLS enabled, with certificates signed by Let's Encrypt. 

         .. code-block:: json
            :copyable: false

            {
               "clientAppId": "sync-template-app-zkiee",
               "query": {
                  "Item": "truepredicate",
                  "Project": "truepredicate"
               },
               "cloudSyncServerAuthSecret": "3814f3fb7befe2eef66ee01781ae245a",
               "hostname": "ec2-13-58-70-88.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com",
               "tls" : {
                 "enabled": true,
                 "certificates": [
                   {
                     "publicKeyPath": "certs/cert.pem",
                     "privateKeyPath": "certs/certkey.pem"
                   }
                 ]
               }
            }

         With this example, we explicitly sync data from the ``Item`` and 
         ``Project`` collections, because the App Services schema also 
         has a ``Team`` collection that we don't want to sync to the 
         Edge Server. If we instead wanted to sync all the data in the 
         App Services schema, we could use the default value for the query:
         ``query: "*"``. We could also have more granular queries; for 
         example, only sync Projects where ``facility_id == 42``.

         For more details on what you could include in a query, refer to 
         :ref:`Realm Query Language <rql>`.

   .. step:: Install Dependencies

      The Edge Server requires several dependencies, which are listed 
      in the :file:`README.md` in the ``edge_server`` directory. Follow the 
      instructions to install the required dependencies.

.. _start-and-stop-edge-server:

Start and Stop the Edge Server
------------------------------

To start the server, from the ``edge_server`` directory:

.. code-block:: shell

   make up

.. note::

   You don't have to run the Docker commands as root. However, if you 
   don't, you may get a message similar to this:
   
   .. code-block:: console
      :copyable: false
   
      Couldn't connect to Docker daemon at http+docker://localunixsocket

   If this occurs, you can switch to the root user with ``sudo su``.

Now you can connect clients directly to the Edge Server.

In the App Services logs, you should see an ``Authentication -> Login``
entry whose ``Name`` is ``tiered-sync-token``. This is the Edge Server
connecting to your App Services App.

To stop the server, from the ``edge_server`` directory:

.. code-block:: shell

   make down

.. include:: /includes/important-stop-tiered-sync-server.rst

.. _check-edge-server-status:

Check the Edge Server Status
----------------------------

When the Edge Server is running, you can see the status of the 
Edge Server with:

.. code-block:: shell

   make status

This gives you information about the number of clients connected to the 
server, as well as errors that may have occurred.

.. example::

   The status object of an Edge Server may look similar to:

   .. code-block:: json
      :copyable: false

      {
         "status": "ACTIVE",
         "cloud_connected": true,
         "num_local_clients": 1,
         "query": {
            "Item": "truepredicate"
         }
      }
