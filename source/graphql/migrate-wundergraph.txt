.. important::

   Always refer to the official documentation of both MongoDB Atlas and 
   `WunderGraph <https://docs.wundergraph.com/docs/supported-data-sources/mongodb-atlas>`_
   for the most up-to-date and accurate information. Specific steps may vary
   depending on the details of your project and the technologies used.

`WunderGraph <https://wundergraph.com/>`_ is a comprehensive developer platform
that comes equipped with an extensive variety of open-source tools and Software
Development Kits (SDKs).

One of these integral tools is a `Backend For Frontend (BFF) Framework 
<https://docs.wundergraph.com/docs/use-cases/backend-for-frontend>`_. This BFF
Framework serves as a robust, specification-compliant server library ready to be
implemented in production environments. The notable feature of this library is
its ability to integrate data from any source whatsoever. This includes, but is
not limited to, data from MongoDB Atlas. Also, if you plan on using GraphQL
Federation, take a look at `WunderGraph Cosmo <https://cosmo-docs.wundergraph.com/>`_.

Migrate to WunderGraph
----------------------

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Create a WunderGraph Application

      The WunderGraph BFF is an open source gateway that bundles up your data
      and generates type-safe clients for your frontend framework. If you
      plan on using GraphQL Federation, take a look at WunderGraph Cosmo.

      If you are starting from scratch, follow the `MongoDB / Atlas Data source
      documentation <https://docs.wundergraph.com/docs/wundergraph-config-ts-reference/configure-mongodb-atlas-data-source>`_.
      For more details, refer to the `WunderGraph docs page for Atlas 
      <https://docs.wundergraph.com/docs/supported-data-sources/mongodb-atlas>`_.

   .. step:: Update Client Applications

      Update any client applications that interact with your GraphQL API
      endpoints to point to the new WunderGraph endpoint URLs.

   .. step:: Shut Down Atlas App Services Endpoints

      Once you have verified that your GraphQL API endpoints are fully migrated
      and operational on WunderGraph, you can delete your MongoDB Atlas App
      Services app to avoid unnecessary costs. As a reminder, Atlas GraphQL
      endpoints will no longer be supported beginning March 12, 2025.

Check out the `WunderGraph Cosmo docs <https://cosmo-docs.wundergraph.com/>`_ to
learn how to build a distributed GraphQL architecture that combines multiple
GraphQL APIs to create a unified graph.

Cosmo enables teams and Organizations to manage and scale (federated) GraphQL
Architectures with ease. Quickly iterate without breaking anything through
composition checks.

WunderGraph Cosmo can easily run locally, on-premises, or in the cloud as a
managed service. Cosmo is a batteries-included solution, covering everything
from routing to analytics with the whole platform.

Cosmo supports monolithic GraphQL APIs as well as Federation v1 and v2 including
Subscriptions.
