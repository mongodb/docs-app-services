   Always refer to the official documentation of both MongoDB Atlas and `Hasura 
   <https://hasura.io/docs/latest/databases/mongodb/mongodb-atlas/>`_
   for the most up-to-date and accurate information. Specific steps may vary
   depending on the details of your project and the technologies
   used.

Hasura empowers developers to rapidly build and deploy GraphQL and `REST APIs
on MongoDB <https://hasura.io/graphql/database/mongodb>`_ and many other data
sources. By radically cutting down API development times, Hasura enables rapid
access to data, reduces friction across teams and services, and enables
enterprises to shorten time to market on data-powered products and features.

Before You Begin
----------------

If you haven't already, Create an account on Hasura's website `cloud.hasura.io 
<https://cloud.hasura.io/signup?utm_source=mongodb&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=mongodb_developer_portal>`_.

Migrate to Hasura
-----------------

Migrating your GraphQL API endpoints from MongoDB Atlas App Services to Hasura
involves a multi-step process that encompasses setting up your environment in
Hasura, configuring database connections, migrating schemas, and implementing
authorization and authentication mechanisms. Below is an expanded guide
detailing each step, with a focus on authorization and role-based access control
(RBAC) within Hasura. For more information, check out the `Hasura docs 
<https://hasura.io/docs/latest/databases/mongodb/mongodb-atlas/>`_.

To migrate to Hasura:

#. Create a new project in Hasura
#. Authorize Hasura for MongoDB
#. Migrate your GraphQL schema
#. Test your GraphQL queries
#. Handle authorization and authentication
#. Set up custom resolvers
#. Update client applications
#. Shut down MongoDB Atlas App Services

Create a New Project in Hasura
------------------------------

.. procedure::

   .. step::

      After logging in to Hasura, navigate to Projects and create a new project
      by clicking on :guilabel:`New Project`. Select a pricing plan, cloud
      provider, and region that aligns with your MongoDB Atlas setup for optimal
      performance.

      .. image:: /images/migration/new-project.png
         :alt: Hasura projects page

   .. step::

      After creating your project, take note of the Hasura Cloud IP on this page
      as you'll use this in your MongoDB Atlas setup to authorize Hasura for
      MongoDB.

      .. image:: /images/migration/cloud-ip.png
         :alt: Project information page

   .. step::

      Click on :guilabel:`Launch Console` to open up the Hasura Console.

   .. step::

      Click on the :guilabel:`DATA` tab at the top, choose MongoDB from the list
      of various databases that Hasura supports, and click :guilabel:`Connect
      Existing Database`.

Authorize Hasura for MongoDB
----------------------------

Hasura can connect to a new or existing MongoDB Atlas database and generate the
GraphQL API for you.

.. procedure::

   .. step::

      Go to ``cloud.mongodb.com`` and navigate to the Network Access page on the
      Atlas dashboard.

   .. step::

      Click the :guilabel:`ADD IP ADDRESS` button and enter the Hasura Cloud IP
      that you obtained from the Hasura Cloud dashboard earlier. Describe this
      entry as Hasura. 
      
      Now, Hasura Cloud can communicate with your MongoDB Atlas instance.

      .. image:: /images/migration/add-ip.png
         :alt: Network access page.

   .. step::

      On the Database page, find the Atlas cluster that is connected to
      your App Services app and click on :guilabel:`Connect`. Select the Drivers
      option and copy the connection string.

      .. image:: /images/migration/connection-string.png
         :alt: Get Atlas clust connection string.

   .. step::

      Go back to the Hasura Cloud dashboard. On the Connect Existing Database
      for MongoDB page, enter the name of the MongoDB database you want to
      connect to and the connection string you copied from the previous step.

      .. image:: /images/migration/add-connection-string.png
         :alt: Add Atlas connection string to Hasura project.

   .. step::

      Click :guilabel:`Connect Database`.
      You are finished setting up the connection between Hasura and MongoDB,
      each hosted on their respective Cloud instances.

Migrate GraphQL Schema
----------------------

Migrate your MongoDB Atlas GraphQL schema to Hasura's GraphQL schema. This
involves defining your types, queries, mutations, and subscriptions in the
Hasura Console or the Hasura CLI.

.. procedure::

   .. step::

      In the Hasura console click the Data tab and select your MongoDB database
      from the left hand pane.

      You'll see all the collections from your MongoDB database.

      .. image:: /images/migration/collections.png
         :alt: Atlas collections are listed in a table.

   .. step::

      To generate a schema for a collection, click on the :guilabel:`Track`
      button next to the desired collection.

      You have three options to infer the schema of a collection:

      - Infer the schema from a sample document you copy and paste from your
        collection.
      - :guilabel:`Use Database Schema` allows you to use your database's
        validation schema if one is present in your database (a GraphQL schema
        will be automatically generated for you).
      - :guilabel:`Use Existing Logical Model` allows you to select a previously
        created logical model.

      .. image:: /images/migration/generate-schema.png
         :alt: Generate a new schema by using a sample document.

   .. step::

      Click the :guilabel:`Validate` button to validate the JSON document. In
      the next step, you will see the models derived from this document.
      Finally, click the :guilabel:`Track Collection` button.

Test Your GraphQL Queries
-------------------------

After tracking a collection and getting a schema, you can navigate to the API
Explorer page on the Hasura Console to test out some GraphQL queries.

Hasura also uses the GraphiQL interface, which is similar to how you test
queries in Atlas App Services.

.. image:: /images/migration/test-queries.png
   :alt: Use the GraphiQL interface to test queries.

Authorization and Authentication
--------------------------------

Hasura does not directly handle authentication. Instead, it relies on session
variables provided by an external authentication service. These session
variables include user, role, and organization information crucial for
determining data access rights. For details, refer to the `Hasura authentication
docs <https://hasura.io/docs/latest/auth/overview/>`_

Data access permissions, including roles and rule expressions, can be converted
into Hasura role-based permission rules.

All Authentication methods that Atlas provides are compatible with Hasura's
Webhook and JWT auth methods. If you are using Email/Pass, Anonymous, or API Key
authentication, use Hasura Webhook. If you are using a Custom JWT, integrate
directly with Hasura's JWT auth method.

Hasura recommends using an external IdP for managing authentication processes
for enhanced security and flexibility. You can integrate Hasura with any
authentication provider of your choice, such as Auth0, Firebase Auth, AWS
Cognito, or even a custom solution, to verify the user and set the necessary
session variables. For configuring JWT or webhook authentication in Hasura,
refer to the documentation at:

- `JWT Authentication <https://hasura.io/docs/latest/auth/authentication/jwt/>`_
- `Webhook Authentication <https://hasura.io/docs/latest/auth/authentication/webhook/>`_

Set Up Custom Resolvers
-----------------------

If your existing GraphQL API endpoints include custom resolvers or business
logic, you'll need to implement these in Hasura. Hasura supports custom business
logic using remote schemas, event triggers, and actions.

Hasura Actions can be used to create custom resolvers. Custom queries and
mutations including their payload type and input type can be defined within
Hasura, and Hasura can integrate with the resolver function over HTTP. 

.. image:: /images/migration/actions.png
   :alt: Use Hasura Actions to create custom resolvers.

The resolver function must be deployed somewhere and Hasura can generate the
JavaScript code for the function.

.. image:: /images/migration/resolver-codegen.png
   :alt: Hasura auto generates Action code.

Update Client Applications
--------------------------

Update any client applications that interact with your GraphQL API endpoints to
point to the new Hasura endpoint URLs. Any existing Apollo client will work with
Hasura.

Update the GraphQL operations used by applications to match Hasura-style GraphQL
operations. 

Shut down MongoDB Atlas App Services
------------------------------------

Once you have verified that your GraphQL API endpoints are fully migrated
and operational on Apollo Server, you can delete your MongoDB Atlas App
Services app to avoid unnecessary costs. As a reminder, Atlas GraphQL
endpoints will no longer be supported beginning March 12, 2025.
