================
Domain Migration
================

The App Services base URL will be updated from ``https://realm.mongodb.com/``
to a new URL: ``https://services.cloud.mongodb.com``.

This change applies to the App Services UI, Admin API requests, and client
API requests through the Atlas Device SDKs.

Relevant SDK versions
---------------------

Starting in the following versions, the SDKs will use the new base URL by
default:

- C++ SDK: version TBD
- Flutter SDK: version TBD
- Java SDK: version TBD
- Kotlin SDK: version TBD
- .NET SDK: version TBD
- Node.js SDK: version TBD
- React Native SDK: version TBD
- Swift SDK: version TBD

Begin Migration Now
-------------------

The new URL (``https://services.cloud.mongodb.com``) is available now and you
can begin using it by specifying a base URL in your app configuration. You should
also update your domain access lists to allow the new URL.

Refer to the SDK docs for details about specifying a base URL:

- :ref:`C++ SDK <cpp-access-the-app-client>`
- :ref:`Flutter SDK <flutter-app-client-configuration>`
- :ref:`Java SDK <java-app-client-configuration>`
- :ref:`Kotlin SDK <kotlin-app-client-configuration>`
- :ref:`.NET SDK <dotnet-app-client-configuration>`
- :ref:`Node.js SDK <node-access-the-app-client>`
- :ref:`React Native SDK <react-native-app-client-configuration>`
- :ref:`Swift SDK <ios-app-client-configuration>`

The old URL (``https://realm.mongodb.com/``) will continue to work, but will be
deprecated in the future. We recommend migrating to the new URL as soon as
possible.
