As of September 2024, the Atlas Device SDKs and HTTPS Endpoints are deprecated
and will reach end of life in September 2025. Due to this deprecation,
Functions be primarily used by Triggers. For that reason, the Functions
documentation has been to `MongoDB Atlas Documentation -> Triggers/Functions
<https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-ui/triggers/functions/>`__.

For more details, refer to :ref:`app-services-deprecation`.
