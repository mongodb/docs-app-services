Find Your App ID
----------------

Every App has a unique ID. You use App IDs to specify which app you want
to use or modify.

You can find your Project ID in the App Services UI or use the Admin API
or App Services CLI to find it programmatically.

.. tabs-realm-admin-interfaces::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: ui

      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Find Your App in the Atlas UI

            Log into the `MongoDB Atlas UI
            <https://cloud.mongodb.com?tck=docs_realm>`_ and then click the
            :guilabel:`App Services` tab.

            Find your App and click on its summary card to open the App.

               :alt: An overview of all apps associated with an Atlas Project in the UI

         .. step:: Copy Your App ID

            Click the :guilabel:`Copy App ID` button next to the name of your
            App near the top of the left navigation menu.

            .. note::

                The UI displays your App name in the top left. When you click the
                copy button, the UI copies your App ID, not your App's name, into
                your clipboard. For example, the UI would display the name
                "exampleApp" but copy the id "exampleApp-wlkgs".

               :alt: The location of the copy app id button in the UI

   .. tab::
      :tabid: cli

      To find an App ID, run :ref:`realm-cli apps list
      <realm-cli-apps-list>` and find the App you're interested in the
      list returned by the command.

      Each entry in the list contains two App ID values you may want:

      - The Client App ID, which is a unique string that includes the
        App name. Use this value to connect to your App through GraphQL,
        the Data API, or a Realm SDK.

      - The ``_id`` value, which is an internal ObjectId hex string. Use
        this value in place of ``{appId}`` in Admin API endpoints.

   .. tab::
      :tabid: api

      To find an App ID, send a request to the :admin-api-endpoint:`List
      All Apps <operation/adminListApplications>` API endpoint.

      The endpoint returns a list of Apps associated with the Atlas
      project. Find the App you're interested in and copy its App ID.

      There are two App ID values you may want:

      - The ``_id`` value, which is an internal ObjectId hex string. Use this
        value in place of ``{appId}`` in Admin API endpoints.

      - The ``client_app_id``, which is a unique string that includes the App
        name. Use this value to connect to your App through GraphQL, the Data
        API, or a Realm SDK.

         Make sure to replace ``<access_token>`` and ``{groupId}`` with
         your own values.

.. _find-atlas-project-id:

Find Your Atlas Project ID
--------------------------

Every App is associated with a single Atlas project. You use the
project's unique Project ID value, sometimes referred to as a "Group
ID", to identify and work with your App programatically.

You can find your Project ID in the Atlas UI or use the Atlas Admin API
or Atlas CLI to find it programmatically.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Atlas UI
      :tabid: ui

      You can find your Project ID in the App Services Admin UI.

      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Choose Your Atlas Organization

            In the upper left-hand corner of your Atlas Dashboard, you'll see
            a drop-down menu that contains the Organizations you can access.
            Select the Organization that contains the Project you'd like to
            view.

         .. step:: Find Your Project

            Click :guilabel:`Projects` in the left navigation menu to view the
            list of project in the Organization. Find your project in the
            list.

         .. step:: Copy the Project ID

            The right side of the project list view contains an :guilabel:`Actions`
            column. Click the ellipses (:guilabel:`...`) icon to expand the Actions menu, and select
            :guilabel:`Copy Project ID`.

   .. tab:: Atlas CLI
      :tabid: cli

      You can list all Atlas projects that you have access to with the
      Atlas CLI's ``projects list`` command.

      The command returns a list of projects in JSON format. Find
      your project in the list and copy its ``id`` value.
