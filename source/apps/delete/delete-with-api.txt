You can use the :ref:`App Services Admin API <admin-api>` to delete a server-side
App.

Prerequisites
-------------
A `MongoDB Atlas
<https://www.mongodb.com/realm?tck=docs_realm#atlas-form-container>`_
:atlas:`programmatic API key </configure-api-access/#programmatic-api-keys>`
for the MongoDB Cloud account you wish to log in with. You must be a
:atlas:`Project Owner </reference/user-roles/#project-roles>` of the 
Atlas project where you want to delete the App.

Procedure
---------

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Authenticate a MongoDB Atlas User

      .. include:: /includes/api-authenticate-instructions.rst


   .. step:: Get the Group ID

      To delete a app you need the Project ID (sometimes referred to as
      the Group ID) of the MongoDB Atlas project that contains the App. You will
      include this ID in the URL of API requests.


   .. step:: Get the Application ID

      To delete an App you will need to find the Application ID of the app.

      .. include:: /includes/api-get-application-id.rst

      Find the app you want to delete and save the ``_id`` field for the last step.


   .. step:: Delete the App

      The API has an :admin-api-endpoint:`endpoint <operation/adminDeleteApplication>`
      through which you can delete an App.
      Your request should include:

      - The ``access_token`` from step 1 in a :mdn:`Bearer token <Web/HTTP/Authentication>` ``Authorization`` header.

      - The :admin-api-endpoint:`Group ID/Project ID <section/Project-and-Application-IDs>` from step 2.

      - The :admin-api-endpoint:`Application ID <section/Get-Authentication-Tokens>` from step 3.

      .. code-block:: shell

         curl --request DELETE 'https://realm.mongodb.com/api/admin/v3.0/groups/<GroupID>/apps/<ApplicationID>' \
           --header 'Authorization:  Bearer <access_token>' \
           --header 'Content-Type: application/json'

      If your application deletes successfully, App Services returns a ``204`` response.
