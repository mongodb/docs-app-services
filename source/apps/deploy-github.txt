Overview
--------

You can configure an Atlas App Services App to automatically deploy
whenever you push App configuration files to a :github:`GitHub <>`
repository. You can clone the GitHub repository to your computer and
then use standard Git commands to pull down the latest versions and
deploy new changes.

Prerequisites
-------------

- A :github:`GitHub <>` account and repository. The repository should
  either be empty or contain an exported configuration directory for an
  existing App. For information on how to create an empty repository,
  see GitHub's `create a repo
  <https://help.github.com/en/articles/create-a-repo>`_ guide.

- An installed copy of the Git CLI. If you do not have ``git``
  installed, see the official guide for `Installing Git
  <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Getting-Started-Installing-Git>`_.

- A `MongoDB Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/realm?tck=docs_realm#atlas-form-container>`_ 
  :atlas:`Programmatic API Key </configure-api-access/#programmatic-api-keys>` 
  to authenticate and authorize access to your app's underlying Git
  repo. If you have not yet generated a programmatic API key for your
  Atlas organization, do so now.

Enable Automatic Deployment with GitHub
---------------------------------------

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Install the Atlas App Services GitHub App

      In order to automatically deploy based on a GitHub repository,
      Atlas App Services requires that you install a GitHub app that has, at minimum,
      read access to the repository.

      To install the app, click :guilabel:`Deployment` in the left navigation menu of the App Services UI.
      Select the :guilabel:`Configuration` tab and then click :guilabel:`Install
      App Services on GitHub`. A new browser window will open to the GitHub application
      installation flow.

      .. note:: GitHub Authentication

         GitHub may require you to provide your GitHub account credentials before
         you can install the app.

      Select the GitHub account or organization for which you want to install the
      app:

      .. figure:: /images/github-app-install-location.png
         :alt: GitHub Application install location screen

      Specify one or more repositories for which you want to grant App Services read
      access. You can either select specific repositories or grant access to all of
      your repositories on GitHub. Select the repositories you want to use and then
      click :guilabel:`Install`.

      .. figure:: /images/github-app-install-permissions.png
         :alt: GitHub Application permissions request screen

      After you install the application, click :guilabel:`Authorize` to finish
      connecting App Services to GitHub. This leads you to a github permissions screen,
      where you will click :guilabel:`Authorize App Services`.

      .. figure:: /images/authorize-mdb-realm-github.png
         :alt: GitHub Application authorization request screen

      .. note:: GitHub Permissions

         You can manage permissions for the App Services GitHub application from
         the :github:`Installed GitHub Apps <settings/installations>` page in your
         GitHub settings.


   .. step:: Specify a GitHub Repository

      Once you have linked your GitHub account to your App, you can specify a
      repository that App Services should automatically deploy. Specify the
      :guilabel:`Repository`, :guilabel:`Branch`, and :guilabel:`Directory` that
      contain the App's configuration files and then click :guilabel:`Save`.

      .. figure:: /images/automatic-deploy-select-repo.png
         :alt: GitHub repository selection
         :width: 750px

      .. note::

         The list of repositories will only contain repos that you have
         granted App Services read access to.


   .. step:: Initialize the Repository

      Clone a local copy of the Git repository that you specified:

      .. code-block:: shell

         git clone https://github.com/<organization>/<repo>.git

      The configured branch and directory must contain configuration
      files that define your application. You can create the
      configuration manually or :ref:`export the application directory
      <export-app>` of an existing app.

      Add the application directory to the repository and then commit the changes:

      .. code-block:: shell

         git add -A
         git commit -m "Adds App Services Application Directory"

      Once you have committed the latest version of the application to the
      repository, push it to your GitHub repository:

      .. code-block:: shell

         git push origin <branch name>


   .. step:: Enable Automatic Deployment

      After you have specified a repository to deploy and initialized it with the
      latest version of your app, you need to enable automatic deployment to begin
      deploying it. On the :guilabel:`Configuration` tab of the :guilabel:`Deploy`
      page, click :guilabel:`Enable Automatic Deployment`. In the modal that
      appears, click :guilabel:`Enable Automatic Deployment` to confirm your
      selection.

      .. figure:: /images/enable-automatic-deployment.png
         :alt: Enable Automatic GitHub Deployment in the App Services UI


   .. step:: Make Changes to Your Application

      A deployment contains one or more changes that you have made to your
      application since the previous deployment. Make any additions, modifications,
      or deletions to the repository that you want to include in your deployment.

      Refer to the :ref:`app-configuration` reference page and individual component
      reference pages for details on the structure and schema of your application
      directory.

      .. important:: Do not make breaking schema changes via automated deploy

         Because :ref:`breaking - also called destructive - schema changes
         <destructive-changes-synced-schema>` require special handling, App Services
         does not support making breaking schema changes via automated deploy
         with GitHub. Instead, you should make breaking changes from the
         App Services UI.


   .. step:: Commit and Push Your Changes

      Once you have updated your application configuration, you can deploy the
      updates as a new version of your App by pushing them to the GitHub repo
      that you specified. If Automatic GitHub Deployment is enabled,
      App Services immediately deploys the latest commit for the configured
      branch and directory.

      When you are ready to deploy, commit all of the files that you want to include
      and then push them to GitHub:

      .. code-block:: sh

         git add -A
         git commit -m "<commit message>"
         git push origin <branch name>

      Once you successfully push your changes to GitHub, App Services
      immediately deploys a new version of your application that matches the state
      of the latest commit. Client applications will automatically use the newest
      version, so make sure that you also update your client code to use the new
      version if necessary.

      .. note:: Deployment History

         You can see the currently deployed version of your
         application as well as a historical log of previous
         deployments in the :ref:`Deployment History
         <deployment-history>` table in the App Services UI.


.. _deploy-github-make-changes-ui:

Make Changes from the UI
------------------------

Automatic GitHub deployment does not prevent you from making changes
to your App from the App Services UI. You can make changes to your 
app via the UI, and App Services automatically commits changes back to 
your linked GitHub repository.

.. tip::

   If your linked GitHub repository contains new commits that are not reflected
   in your App Services UI changes, App Services can't automatically
   commit those changes to your repo. However, you can use the 
   :guilabel:`Export` button to download the updated configuration files 
   to your local machine, and then you push them manually to your GitHub 
   repository.

When changes are committed to your linked GitHub repository, you'll see a
:guilabel:`Commit: <commit-hash>` link in your app's Deployment History.

.. figure:: /images/deploy-history-link-to-github-commit.png
   :alt: GitHub repository selection

You can click that link to view the commit in GitHub. The ``mongodb-realm`` 
bot appears as the commit author.

.. _deploy-github-make-changes-cli:

Avoid Making Changes from the CLI
---------------------------------

With automatic GitHub deployment enabled, avoid making changes to your app 
with {+cli+} because:

- If you push changes with the CLI while GitHub deployment is enabled, App Services 
  deploys the changes but does not commit them back to your linked repository.
- The configuration files in your repository no longer reflect the current 
  state of your app.
- To get the changes you pushed, a contributor must manually pull the latest 
  configuration files directly from your App. The GitHub repository is
  no longer the source of truth. 
- If a contributor adds a new commit to a stale repo, they overwrite any 
  deployed but uncommitted changes.

Summary
-------

- You can deploy your App by modifying a repo hosted on GitHub.

- While Automatic GitHub Deployment is enabled, App Services immediately
  deploys the latest commit. To deploy, commit your changes locally, then push
  them to your repo on GitHub.

- When you make changes via the App Services UI after enabling Automatic 
  GitHub Deployment, those changes are automatically committed back to your 
  linked repository.

- Do not use {+cli+} to update configuration files after enabling 
  Automatic GitHub Deployment.
