You can use the :ref:`Atlas App Services CLI <realm-cli-quickstart>` to create a new server-side
App.

Prerequisites
-------------

- A :ref:`properly installed <install-realm-cli>` copy of {+cli-bin+} that has
  been added to your system ``PATH``.

- A `MongoDB Atlas
  <https://www.mongodb.com/realm?tck=docs_realm#atlas-form-container>`_
  :atlas:`programmatic API key </configure-api-access/#programmatic-api-keys>`
  for the MongoDB Cloud account you wish to log in with. You must be a
  :atlas:`Project Owner </reference/user-roles/#project-roles>` to create an
  App.

Procedure
---------

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Authenticate a MongoDB Atlas User


      .. include:: /includes/cli-login.rst


   .. step:: Run the App Creation Command

      The CLI can create an app and copy its :ref:`configuration files
      <app-configuration>` to a local directory with a single command. The command
      asks you to specify the app name and the Atlas project that should contain the
      app. You can configure the command with flags or interactively.

      .. code-block:: shell

         realm-cli apps create

      The command also supports additional flags that you can optionally include
      to customize your app. The following table lists common flags you might use:

      .. list-table::

         * - ``--template``
           - Choose a :ref:`template app <template-apps>` to start from.

             For a list of all template apps, refer to :ref:`Available Template Apps
             <template-apps-list>`.

         * - ``--deployment-model``
           - Defines the app's :ref:`deployment model <deployment-model>`.

             Valid values:

             - ``GLOBAL``
             - ``LOCAL``

         * - ``--location``
           - Defines a local app's :ref:`deployment region <deployment-region>`.

         * - ``--environment``
           - Defines the app's :ref:`environment <environment-values>`.

             Valid values:

             - ``development``
             - ``testing``
             - ``qa``
             - ``production``

        :ref:`CLI documentation for the create command <realm-cli-apps-create>`.
