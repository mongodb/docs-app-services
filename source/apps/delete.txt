.. tabs-realm-admin-interfaces::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: ui

      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Navigate to the App Services Tab

            Go to the Project Dashboard where you want to delete the App.
            Select the :guilabel:`App Services` tab.

         .. step:: Delete the App

            To delete an app, click the :guilabel:`...` menu at the upper
            right corner of the tile for the app you want to delete.

            Then, select :guilabel:`Delete App` from the drop-down menu
            that appears.

            The page prompts you to confirm that you want to delete this
            app. Click :guilabel:`Delete App` to confirm and delete the
            App.

   .. tab::
      :tabid: cli

      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Authenticate a MongoDB Atlas User

            .. include:: /includes/cli-login.rst

         .. step:: (Optional) List All Apps

            Although the ``delete`` command will show you a list of apps available to delete,
            You may want to use the ``list`` command to see all your apps and find out which
            you plan to delete before running the ``delete`` command.

            .. code-block:: shell

               realm-cli apps list

            For more details about each app, you can use:

            .. code-block:: shell

               realm-cli apps describe

            .. seealso::

               For more details and additional flags, see the CLI documentation for the
               :ref:`list <realm-cli-apps-list>`
               and :ref:`describe <realm-cli-apps-describe>` commands.

         .. step:: Run the App Delete Command

            The CLI can delete one or more apps with the following command:

            .. code-block:: shell

               realm-cli apps delete

            If you have more than one App, you will be prompted to select one or
            more apps that you would like to delete from a list of all your Apps.

            If you already know the name or id of the app you would like to delete, you can specify it:

            .. code-block:: shell

               realm-cli apps delete --app <name or id>

            .. seealso::

               For more details and additional flags, see the
               CLI documentation for the :ref:`delete <realm-cli-apps-delete>` command.

   .. tab::
      :tabid: api

      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Authenticate a MongoDB Atlas User

            .. include:: /includes/api-authenticate-instructions.rst

         .. step:: Get the Project ID

            Every App Services App belongs to a MongoDB Atlas project.

            To delete an App you need the Project ID (sometimes referred to as
            the Group ID) of the MongoDB Atlas project that contains the app.
            You will include this ID in the URL of API requests.

         .. step:: Get the App ID

            To delete an App you need its App ID.

            .. include:: /includes/api-get-application-id.rst

         .. step:: Delete the App

            Send a request to the :admin-api-endpoint:`Delete an App
            <operation/adminDeleteApplication>` endpoint.

            Your request should include:

            - The ``access_token`` from step 1 in a :mdn:`Bearer token <Web/HTTP/Authentication>` ``Authorization`` header.

            - The :admin-api-endpoint:`Group ID/Project ID <section/Project-and-Application-IDs>` from step 2.

            - The :admin-api-endpoint:`Application ID <section/Get-Authentication-Tokens>` from step 3.

            .. code-block:: shell

               curl --request DELETE 'https://realm.mongodb.com/api/admin/v3.0/groups/{groupId}/apps/{appId}' \
                 --header 'Authorization:  Bearer <access_token>' \
                 --header 'Content-Type: application/json'

            If your application deletes successfully, App Services returns a ``204`` response.
