Overview
--------

Email/password authentication lets users register and login using an email address.
Atlas App Services must confirm Email/Password users before they may log in.

Users may choose one of three ways to handle user confirmation:

- :ref:`Send a Confirmation Email <auth-send-a-confirmation-email>`

- :ref:`Run a Confirmation Function <auth-run-a-confirmation-function>`

- :ref:`Automatically Confirm Users <auth-automatically-confirm-users>`

The following diagram shows the process flow for logging in:

    :width: 350px

.. note::

   User email addresses are case-sensitive. For example, a user with the
   email address ``TestAccount@example.com`` could not log in using the
   ``testaccount@example.com`` address.

Configuration
-------------

.. tabs-realm-admin-interfaces::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: ui

      - In the left navigation, click Authentication. 
      - In the list of Authentication providers, select 
        :guilabel:`Email/Password`. From this screen, you can 
        configure and enable the provider. Use the following sections to 
        guide you through the process. 

   .. tab::
      :tabid: cli

      To enable and configure the Email/Password authentication provider with
      :ref:`realm-cli <realm-cli-quickstart>`, define a :ref:`configuration 
      object <appconfig-auth>` for it in ``/auth/providers.json``.

      Email/Password provider configurations have the following form:

      .. code-block:: json
         :caption: /auth/providers.json
         
         {
           "local-userpass": {
             "name": "local-userpass",
             "type": "local-userpass",
             "config": {
               "autoConfirm": <boolean>,
               "emailConfirmationUrl": <string>,
               "confirmEmailSubject": <string>,
               "runConfirmationFunction": <boolean>,
               "confirmationFunctionName": <string>,
               "resetPasswordUrl": <string>,
               "resetPasswordSubject": <string>,
               "runResetFunction": <boolean>,
               "resetFunctionName": <string>,
             },
             "disabled": <boolean>
           }
         }

.. _email-password-authentication-confirmation:

User Confirmation
-----------------
User confirmation occurs when a user wants to create a new Email/password 
account. Atlas App Services supports three methods for confirming a user account:

- Send a confirmation email
- Run a confirmation function
- Automatically create the account with no validation.

.. warning:: 

   Automatically creating accounts is useful when developing and testing an app, 
   but you should not use it in a production app.

The following diagram shows the process flow for confirming a user: 

.. figure:: /images/email-password-confirmation-flow.png
    :alt: Email/password confirmation flow diagram

.. _auth-send-a-confirmation-email:

Send a Confirmation Email
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With this confirmation method, users must respond to an email upon 
registration. The email contains a link to a confirmation URL. The 
user must visit this link within 30 minutes to confirm that they 
control the email address.

Configure the following settings to have App Services automatically send a
confirmation email:

- :guilabel:`Email Confirmation URL`: the base of the URL included in
  every confirmation email. App Services appends a unique ``token`` and
  ``tokenId`` to this URL. These serve as query parameters to create a unique link
  for every confirmation. To confirm the user, first extract these query
  parameters from the user's unique URL. Then, pass the ``token`` and ``tokenId``
  to the Client SDK's ``confirmUser`` function.

  Mobile applications can handle email confirmation directly in the app. To do
  this, configure `deep linking
  <https://developer.android.com/training/app-links/deep-linking.html>`_ in
  Android or `universal links
  <https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/General/Conceptual/AppSearch/UniversalLinks.html>`_
  in iOS.

- :guilabel:`Email Confirmation Subject`: the subject line for the email 
  that App Services sends. This value is optional if omitted, 
  App Services uses a default subject line instead. Custom email
  confirmation subjects can contain a maximum of 256 characters.

.. note::

   Confirmation emails are not currently customizable beyond the base URL and
   subject line. In particular, they always come from a ``mongodb.com`` email
   address.
   
   For production apps, we recommend using a confirmation function rather than
   the built-in confirmation email method. Confirmation functions allow you to
   build entirely custom email confirmations. See
   :ref:`auth-run-a-confirmation-function` for more information.


.. _auth-run-a-confirmation-function:

Run a Confirmation Function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The provider can :guilabel:`Run a Confirmation Function` when a new user registers
App Services passes to this function unique 
confirmation tokens and user data. The return value is one of two outcomes. 
Either App Services immediately confirms the user, or requires additional 
confirmation. Confirmation must come from the client application.


Within the function, you can define custom logic to confirm users.
For example:

- Send custom confirmation emails from a specific domain.
  Send these with a particular template using an external service.

- Read user permissions from a collection in `MongoDB Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/realm?tck=docs_realm#atlas-form-container>`_ 
  or an external REST service. Use to confirm whether a user has authorization to
  use the application.

- Send confirmation messages through a service other than email.

Configure the following settings to have App Services automatically run a
confirmation function:

- :guilabel:`Function`: the function run when a user registers a new
  account with your App. This function must return an
  object containing a ``status`` key. This key maps to a string with one of the
  following values: ``success``, ``pending``, or ``fail``.

The custom confirmation function signature has one parameter. It is an object,
which contains user data and confirmation tokens. These fields are:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 15 30

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - ``username``

     - The user's email address.

   * - ``token``

     - A unique value used to confirm the user's identity. 
       Use in the SDK ``confirmUser`` function.

   * - ``tokenId``

     - A unique value used to confirm the user's identity. 
       Uses the SDK ``confirmUser`` function.


The custom user confirmation function returns an object with a status field.
The following table describes the potential values of this field:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 15 30

   * - Status
     - Effect

   * - ``success``

     - App Services confirms the user's identity, allowing the user to log
       into their new account.

   * - ``pending``

     - App Services changes the user's confirmation status to ``pending``.
       This does not confirm the user's identity or allow login. 
       The client application must call the ``confirmUser`` SDK function to confirm.

   * - ``fail``

     - App Services deletes the pending user. The user can only retry
       account confirmation by registering an entirely new account.
       Since the previous account no longer exists, the same username
       can be reused.

A user confirmation function is generally structured as follows:

.. code-block:: javascript

   exports = ({ token, tokenId, username }) => {
      // validate the username
      const isValidEmail = myFakeValidator.validate(username);

      // check if the user is privileged for this service
      const isPrivileged = myFakeAuth.hasAccess(username, 'myFakeService')

      // send a message to the user in some way so that the user can confirm themselves
      const msgSendSuccessful = isValidEmail && isPrivileged && myFakeMsgr.send(username, token, tokenId)

      if ( msgSendSuccessful ) {
         return { status: 'pending' };
      } else {
         return { status: 'fail' };
      }
   }

.. _auth-automatically-confirm-users:

Automatically Confirm Users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can configure the provider to
:guilabel:`Automatically Confirm Users`. When selected, App Services immediately confirms
new Email/Password users after registration.

.. warning::

   App Services does not validate automatically confirmed email addresses. As
   a result, there are a few reasons you may not be able to contact such
   users via email:

   - An automatically confirmed user's email address might not actually
     belong to that user. (e.g. a user could sign up as
     ``steve.jobs@apple.com``)
   - A user's email address may not even be a valid email address. (e.g.
     a user could sign up as ``my.name@gmail`` or ``asdavaskljj``)

   Exercise caution with this option. *Securely* resetting the
   password of a user account with no valid contact information
   can be very difficult.

.. _email-password-authentication-password-resets:

Password Resets
---------------

Users can choose one of two ways to handle password resets:

- :ref:`Send a Password Reset Email
  <auth-send-a-password-reset-email>`

- :ref:`Run a Password Reset Function
  <auth-run-a-password-reset-function>`

.. _auth-send-a-password-reset-email:

Send a Password Reset Email
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can configure the provider to :guilabel:`Send a Password Reset Email.`
When a user requests a password reset, App Services sends a
Password Reset URL to a user's email address. The user must visit
this URL within 30 minutes.

When you configure password reset emails, you can configure the following settings:

- :guilabel:`Password Reset URL`: the base of the URL included in every
  password reset email. App Services appends a unique ``token`` and
  ``tokenId`` to this URL. These serve as query parameters to create a unique link
  for every password reset. To reset the user's password, extract these
  query parameters from the user's unique URL. Pass the token and
  tokenId to the Client SDK's ``resetPassword`` function.

- :guilabel:`Reset Password Email Subject`: the subject line for the 
  email that App Services sends. This value is optional: if omitted,
  App Services uses a default subject line instead. Custom password
  reset subjects can contain a maximum of 256 characters.

.. note:: Use Deep Links in Mobile Apps

   Mobile applications can handle password resets directly in the app.
   Configure `deep linking
   <https://developer.android.com/training/app-links/deep-linking.html>`_
   in Android or `universal links
   <https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/General/Conceptual/AppSearch/UniversalLinks.html>`_
   in iOS.

.. _auth-run-a-password-reset-function:

Run a Password Reset Function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can configure the provider to :guilabel:`Run a Password Reset
Function`. You define a :doc:`Function </functions>` for App Services to run when you ``callResetPasswordFunction()`` in the SDK. 
App Services passes this function unique confirmation tokens and data
about the user. Use these values to define custom logic to reset a user's password. 
App Services can immediately reset the user's password. Or you can require additional
confirmation from the client application.

You can use a custom password reset function to define your own password
reset flows:

- Send custom password reset emails from a specific domain with a
  particular template using an external service.

- Interface with a MongoDB Atlas collection to implement a password
  reset "cooldown period". This can prevent too many password reset
  attempts on a single account in a particular time range.

- Send custom password reset messages through a service other than
  email.

App Services can automatically run a password reset function.
Configure the following settings:

- :guilabel:`Function`: the function run when an instance of the client
  SDK calls ``callResetPasswordFunction``. This function
  must return an object containing a ``status`` key. The key maps to a string
  with one of the following values: ``success``, ``pending``, or
  ``fail``.

.. note::

   Using a password reset function causes the client SDK ``sendResetPasswordEmail()`` 
   function to return an error. The password reset function may return a ``pending`` status.
   If so, you may still need to call ``resetPassword()``.

The custom password reset function signature is
:wikipedia:`variadic <Variadic_function>`: it accepts any number of
parameters. The first is always an object containing user data and confirmation tokens.
All following parameters are custom parameters. They are passed into the Client SDK 
as an argument collection. For instance, the Client SDK call:

.. code-block:: javascript

   callResetPasswordFunction("myUsername", "newPassword", ["Security Question Answer 1", "Security Question Answer 2", "securityCode:0510"])


Becomes this customized signature for the password reset function:

.. code-block:: javascript

   resetFunc({username, password, token, tokenId}, securityAnswer1, securityAnswer2, securitySMSCode)

There are multiple elements of the custom argument array. Starting with the second parameter, 
these elements are passed into the password reset function. 

In the custom password reset function, an object must be passed as the 
first parameter. The following table describes the fields found in said object:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 15 30

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - ``username``

     - The email address of the user.

   * - ``password``

     - A new proposed password for the user. If this function returns the
       successful status, this is the user's new password.

   * - ``token``

     - A unique value used to update the user's password.

   * - ``tokenId``

     - A unique value used to confirm the user's identity
       using the SDK ``confirmUser`` function.

The custom password reset function returns an object that contains a ``status`` field.
The value of this ``status`` field may be one of:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 15 30

   * - Status
     - Effect

   * - ``success``

     - App Services changes the user's password to the provided ``password``
       parameter immediately. Only return ``success`` if you authenticate the user's
       identity in the custom function. You might do this with a security question 
       or other secure means.

   * - ``pending``

     - App Services waits for the client application to reset the user's password
       with a client SDK ``resetPassword`` method. The user's password reset status stays
       in the pending state until the client application calls its resetPassword method. 
       For more information on calling the ``resetPassword`` method, refer to the 
       :ref:`client SDK examples <email-password-authentication-examples>`. 

   * - ``fail``

     - Nothing happens.

A custom password reset function is generally structured as follows:

.. code-block:: javascript

   exports = ({ token, tokenId, username, password }) => {
      // check if the username corresponds to a real user
      const isUser = myFakeValidator.validate(username);

      // check if the user has requested a password reset too often recently
      const isNotCoolingDown = myFakeCooldownService.canReset(username, 'myFakeService')

      // send a message to the user in some way so that the user can confirm themselves
      const msgSendSuccessful = isUser && isNotCoolingDown && myFakeMsgr.send(username, token, tokenId)

      if ( msgSendSuccessful ) {
         return { status: 'pending' };
      } else {
         return { status: 'fail' };
      }
   }

.. warning::

   The a Realm SDK function ``callResetPasswordFunction()`` is **not**
   authenticated. Its password recovery is intended only for users who
   cannot otherwise log into their account. As a result, you cannot associate
   any call to this function with a specific App Services user. Returning a
   ``success`` status permanently changes the password to the new value in the
   ``password`` parameter of the function. So returning ``success`` can result 
   in *any user* resetting the password of *any other application user*. For 
   security, you should send the account owner a message via 
   a trusted mode of communication and return ``pending``.

.. _email-password-authentication-examples:

Examples
--------

For examples of registration and log in using email/password 
authentication, see the Realm SDKs:

- :ref:`C++ SDK <cpp-login-email-password>`
- :ref:`Flutter SDK <flutter-login-email-password>`
- :ref:`Java SDK <java-login-email-password>`
- :ref:`Kotlin SDK <kotlin-email-password-login>`
- :ref:`.NET SDK <dotnet-login-email-password>`
- :ref:`Node SDK <node-login-email-password>`
- :ref:`React Native SDK <react-native-login-email-password>`
- :ref:`Swift SDK <ios-login-email-password>`
- :ref:`Web SDK <web-login-email-password>`

.. _email-password-authentication-summary:

Summary
-------

- Email/password authentication allows users to create an identity in
  your application based on a username and a password.
- To enable Email/password authentication, your application should
  support a method of email :ref:`confirmation
  <email-password-authentication-confirmation>`, and a method of
  :ref:`resetting a user's password
  <email-password-authentication-password-resets>`. There are multiple
  implementation options for each of these requirements.
