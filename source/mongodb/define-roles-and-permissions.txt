Overview
--------

Atlas App Services uses a strict rules system that prevents all
operations unless they are specifically allowed. App Services determines
if each operation is allowed dynamically when it receives the request
from the client based on roles that you define.

Roles are sets of document-level and field-level CRUD permissions and
are chosen individually for each document associated with a query. This
guide walks through configuring one or more roles for a collection.

.. important::

   You must define at least one role before you can successfully query a
   collection.

.. important:: Sync Rules
   
   This page describes data access rules for clusters where :ref:`Atlas Device Sync
   <sync>` is not enabled. Synced clusters use a different rules model, which
   takes precedence over non-sync rules. If sync is enabled for a cluster, any
   non-sync rules defined for the cluster do not apply.
   
   For more information on data access rules for synced clusters, see
   :ref:`Sync Rules and Permissions <sync-rules>`.

Procedure
---------

.. note::

   This guide requires a :ref:`linked {+atlas+} data source
   <data-sources>`. Roles and permissions :ref:`do not apply
   <data-federation-caveats>` to {+adf-datasource+}s.

         .. step:: Navigate to the MongoDB Rules Screen

            You can create and manage roles and permissions from the MongoDB rules
            screen in the App Services UI. To get to the rules screen, click
            :guilabel:`Rules` beneath :guilabel:`Data Access` in the
            {+leftnav+}.


         .. step:: Add a MongoDB Collection Namespace

            Data access roles and permissions are scoped to individual collections
            in a linked MongoDB cluster. To define roles and permissions for a
            collection, you need to create the collection namespace in the App Services UI.

            Find the linked cluster that you want to define access permissions for
            in the rules sidebar and click its :guilabel:`context menu
            (...)`. Select :guilabel:`Add Database/Collection`.

            .. figure:: /images/add-database-collection.png
               :alt: Add a Database/Collection button on the collection rules screen.


         .. step:: Configure the Collection Namespace

            Enter the :guilabel:`Database Name` and :guilabel:`Collection Name` of
            the MongoDB collection that you want to use.

            .. figure:: /images/collection-namespace-config-values.png
               :alt: Collection namespace inputs.


         .. step:: Select a Collection Rule Template

            You can choose to apply a rule template to the collection to simplify
            the process of configuring role permissions. Each template is a
            pre-configured set of roles and permissions that represents a common
            use case and data access pattern. You can also select :guilabel:`No
            template`, which creates a default role that can insert and delete
            documents but cannot read or update any fields.

            Once you have selected and configured a template, click :guilabel:`Add
            Collection`.

            .. figure:: /images/collection-rule-templates.png
               :alt: A list of available collection rule templates.

            .. note::

               Templates do not rely on hard-coded field names, so when you select a
               template you will need to map certain fields in your documents to the
               template's fields. For example, the :guilabel:`Users can only read and
               write their own data` template requires that each document in the
               collection contains the ID of the :doc:`user </authentication>` that owns it.
               If you select that template, you will need to specify the name of the
               field that contains the user id.

               .. figure:: /images/rule-template-additional-fields.png
                  :alt: Additional fields for a collection rule template.


         .. step:: Create a New Role

            Depending on the rule template you selected, there will already be one
            or more pre-configured roles in the collection. You can use these
            roles as they are, tweak them to fit your use case, or add additional
            roles to cover more cases.

            To add an additional role, click :guilabel:`New Role`. Enter a
            :guilabel:`Name` for the new role on the role configuration screen.


         .. step:: Define the Role's "Apply When" Condition

            A role's :guilabel:`Apply When` condition determines whether or not
            the role applies to a particular document for the user that issued a
            query.

            Enter a :ref:`rule expression <expressions>` in the role's :guilabel:`Apply
            When` box. The expression should evaluate to ``true`` when the role applies to
            a given document.

            .. figure:: /images/role-apply-when.png
               :alt: A MongoDB Role's Apply When Expression


         .. step:: Define Document-Level Permissions

            Document-level permissions determine a role's ability to insert, delete, and
            :atlas:`search </reference/atlas-search/query-syntax/>` documents in the
            collection. To define the role's :guilabel:`Document-Level Permissions`, check
            the box for each operation that the role has permission to execute.

            Once you have defined the role's document-level permissions, click
            :guilabel:`Done Editing`.

            .. figure:: /images/role-document-level-permissions.png
               :alt: A MongoDB Role's Document-Level Permissions


         .. step:: Define Field-Level Permissions

            Field-level permissions determine if a role can read and write to
            specific fields within a given document. You can define the
            field-level permissions for a role in that role's column on the
            :guilabel:`Rules` page.

            .. list-table::
               :widths: 20 10

               * - **To define permissions for all fields:**

                   Click :guilabel:`Add Field`, enter the field name, then click
                   the green check next to the input box to confirm the name. In
                   the new field's row, check the :guilabel:`Read` and
                   :guilabel:`Write` boxes to indicate whether the role can read
                   or write to the field.

                 - .. figure:: /images/permissions-all-fields.png
                      :alt: A role with permission to read and write to specific fields
                      :width: 300px

               * - **To define permissions for a specific field:**

                   Click :guilabel:`Add Field`, enter the field name, then click
                   the green check next to the input box to confirm the name. In
                   the new field's row, check the :guilabel:`Read` and
                   :guilabel:`Write` boxes to indicate whether the role can read
                   or write to the field.

                 - .. figure:: /images/permissions-specific-fields.png

                      :width: 300px

               * - **To define default permissions for unlisted fields:**

                   Check the :guilabel:`Read` and :guilabel:`Write` boxes for
                   :guilabel:`All Additional Fields` to indicate the role's read and
                   write privileges for any fields that aren't specifically
                   configured.

                 - .. figure:: /images/permissions-additional-fields.png

                      :width: 300px


         .. step:: Add Additional Roles

            Repeat steps 5 through 8 of this procedure for any additional roles
            that you want to configure.

            .. note::

               App Services evaluates roles in order from left-to-right. A user can only
               have one role per document, so once App Services finds a role that
               applies to the current document it skips evaluating any remaining
               roles and immediately begins evaluating a role for the next
               document in the query.


         .. step:: Save the Updated Collection Rules

            Once you have finished defining roles for the collection, click
            :guilabel:`Save`. App Services will immediately begin using the roles you
            defined for all incoming queries on the collection.

   
   .. tab::
      :tabid: cli
      
      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Pull the Latest Version of Your App

            To define roles and permissions for a collection with the {+cli-ref+}, you need a
            local copy of your application's configuration files.

            To pull a local copy of the latest version of your app, run the following:

            .. code-block:: bash

               {+cli-bin+} pull --remote="<Your App ID>"

            .. tip::

               You can also download a copy of your application's configuration files from
               the :guilabel:`Deploy > Export App` screen in the App Services UI.


         .. step:: Add a Rule Configuration File

            To define or modify roles for a collection, open the ``rules.json``
            configuration file within the collection's configuration directory.

            .. tip:: Scaffold the Collection

               If you haven't already defined rules or a schema for the collection, you
               need to manually create its configuration directory and ``schema.json``:

               .. code-block:: bash

                  # Create the collection's configuration directory
                  mkdir -p data_sources/<service>/<db>/<collection>
                  # Create the collection's schema file
                  echo '{}' >> data_sources/<service>/<db>/<collection>/rules.json

            The configuration file should have the following general form:

            .. code-block:: json

               {
                 "database": "<Database Name>",
                 "collection": "<Collection Name>",
                 "roles": [],
                 "filters": []
               }

            .. note::

               This guide focuses on creating ``roles`` for the collection. Check out the
               other configuration guides to learn how to :doc:`create filters
               </mongodb/filter-incoming-queries>` and :ref:`enforce-a-schema`.


         .. step:: Add One or More Roles

            Add a document to the ``roles`` array for each role that you want to
            configure. Role documents have the following form:

            .. code-block:: javascript

               {
                 "name": "<Role Name>",
                 "apply_when": <JSON Expression>,
                 "insert": <boolean>,
                 "delete": <boolean>,
                 "read": <boolean>,
                 "write": <boolean>,
                 "search": <boolean>,
                 "fields": {
                   "<Field Name>": {
                     "read": <boolean>,
                     "write": <boolean>
                   },
                   ...
                 },
                 "additional_fields": {
                   "read": <boolean>,
                   "write": <boolean>
                 }
               }

            .. list-table::
               :header-rows: 1
               :widths: 15 40

               * - Field
                 - Description

               * - ``name``
                 - Required. The name of the role. Limited to 100 characters or
                   fewer.

               * - ``apply_when``
                 - Required. A :ref:`rule expression <expressions>` that determines when
                   this role applies to a given document.

               * - ``insert``
                 - Optional. Default: ``true``. A boolean that, if ``true``,
                   indicates that the role has permission to insert a new
                   document. This document-level permission does not override any
                   field-level permissions configured in ``fields``, i.e. the role
                   must have permission to write to all inserted fields in
                   addition to insert permission.

               * - ``delete``
                 - Optional. Default: ``true``. A boolean that, if ``true``,
                   indicates that the role has permission to delete a new
                   document.

               * - ``search``
                 - Optional. Default: ``true``. A boolean that, if ``true``,
                   indicates that the role has permission to access the document in a
                   :atlas:`$search </reference/atlas-search/query-syntax/>` aggregation.

               * - ``read``
                 - Optional. Default: ``false``. A boolean that, if ``true``,
                   indicates that the role has permission to read *all* fields in
                   a document. This document-level read permission overrides any
                   field-level permissions configured in ``fields``.

               * - ``write``
                 - Optional. Default: ``false``. A boolean that, if ``true``,
                   indicates that the role has permission to write to *all* fields
                   in a document. Further, write permissions require matching read
                   permissions, so if this is ``true``, then ``read`` is also
                   ``true``. These document-level read and write permissions
                   override any field-level permissions configured in ``fields``.

               * - ``fields``
                 - Required. A document where each field matches the name of a
                   field in a collection document. The value of each field is a
                   document that specifies read and write permissions for the
                   field.

                   .. example::

                      .. code-block:: javascript

                         "fields": {
                           "id": {
                              "read": true,
                              "write": false
                           },
                         }

               * - ``additional_fields``
                 - Optional. Default: ``{ "read": false, "write": false }``. A
                   document that specifies the role's default read and write
                   permissions for any fields that are not explicitly defined.

                   .. code-block:: javascript

                      "additional_fields": {
                           "read": true,
                           "write": false
                      }


         .. step:: Deploy the Updated Rules

            Once you've defined and saved ``rules.json`` you can push the updated config
            to your remote app. {+cli+} immediately deploys the new roles and permissions
            on push.

            .. code-block:: bash

               {+cli-bin+} push --remote="<Your App ID>"
