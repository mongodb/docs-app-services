Overview
--------

You can manually configure all aspects of a collection's rules by
editing the underlying configuration document directly through the
{+ui+}. :guilabel:`Advanced Mode` refers to editing rules in this manner. 

When To Use Advanced Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The default or "Basic Mode" rules editor in the {+ui+} covers the
majority of use cases for collection rules. However, there are times
when you need more fine-grained control than the UI interface provides.
Consider using Advanced Mode if you need to do the following:

- Configure a role that can :ref:`only insert documents
  <role-template-insert-only>`.

- Define field-level read or write permissions for a :ref:`field in an
  embedded document <role-template-embedded-documents>`.

- Determine field-level write permissions dynamically using a :ref:`rule
  expression <expressions>`.

.. warning::

   Once you convert a collection's rules to Advanced Mode, you may not
   be able to switch back to editing that collection's rules through the
   Basic Mode interface.

Procedure
---------

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Navigate to the Collection Rules Screen

      You can edit collection rules in Advanced Mode from the MongoDB rules
      screen in the {+ui+}. To get to the rules screen for a collection,
      click :guilabel:`Rules` beneath :guilabel:`Data Access` in the
      {+leftnav+} and then select the collection from the list.

   .. step:: Convert to Advanced Mode

      Click :guilabel:`Advanced Mode` in the top right corner of the
      collection rules interface. The UI will switch an editor that shows a
      preview of the underlying Advanced Mode rule configuration document.
      Click :guilabel:`Convert to Advanced Mode` and then click
      :guilabel:`Convert Rules` to confirm.

   .. step:: Define the Collection Rules

      Once you have converted the collection to Advanced Mode you can edit
      the underlying configuration document. Collection rule configuration
      documents have the following form:

      .. code-block:: json

         {
           "roles": [
             <Role Configuration>,
             ...
           ],
           "filters": [
             <Filter Configuration>,
             ...
           ],
           "schema": {
             "properties": {
               "<Field Name>": <Schema Document>,
               ...
             }
           }
         }

      .. list-table::
        :widths: 30 70
        :header-rows: 1

        * - Field
          - Description

        * - ``roles``
          - An array of :ref:`Role configuration documents <role-config>` that each define a single role's :guilabel:`Apply When` condition and associated CRUD permissions.

            .. important::

                {+service-short+} evaluates roles for each query in the order that
                they're defined. Ensure that each role configuration
                document's array index matches its desired position in the
                evaluation order.

        * - ``filters``
          - An array of :ref:`Filter configuration documents <filter-config>` that each define a filter on the collection.

        * - ``schema``
          - A :ref:`schema <schemas>` that configures the shape and contents of all documents in the collection.

            .. note::

                The root of all collection schemas must be an :ref:`object
                schema document <schema-type-object>`. You can embed other
                :ref:`schema types <schema-types>` inside the ``properties``
                field of the root schema.

                For an example of how to define relationships in advanced
                mode, see: :ref:`Configure Relationships <config-relationships>`.


   .. step:: Save the Updated Collection Rules

      Once you have finished editing the collection rules, click
      :guilabel:`Save`. {+service+} will immediately begin using the new rule
      configuration you defined for all incoming queries on the collection.
