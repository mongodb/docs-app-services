Overview
--------

You can define filters on incoming queries that {+service+} evaluates and
applies before its initial query to your MongoDB cluster. Adding a
filter to a collection allows you to control the shape of queried
documents using projection filters and can improve query performance by
reducing the number of documents for which {+service-short+} needs to evaluate a
role.

Every filter consists of an Apply When :ref:`expression
<expressions>` and a :guilabel:`Filter Query` document. When {+service-short+}
receives an incoming MongoDB query, it evaluates the Apply When
expression of all filters on the collection and merges the :guilabel:`Filter
Query` document into the incoming query.

This guide walks through creating one or more filters for a
collection.

.. note::

   This guide requires a linked :ref:`{+atlas+} data source <data-sources>`.

Procedure
---------

.. tabs-realm-admin-interfaces::
   
   .. tab::
      :tabid: ui
      
      .. procedure::
         :style: normal

         .. step:: Navigate to the MongoDB Rules Screen

            You can create and manage filters from the MongoDB rules screen in the
            {+ui+}. To get to the rules screen, click :guilabel:`Rules` beneath
            :guilabel:`Data Access` in the {+leftnav+}.


         .. step:: Create a New Filter

            Select the collection that you want to configure a filter for from
            the :guilabel:`Rules` menu then click the :guilabel:`Filters` tab.
            Click :guilabel:`New Filter` and enter a :guilabel:`Name` for the new
            filter.


         .. step:: Specify the Apply When Expression

            In the :guilabel:`Apply When` input box, enter a :ref:`rule expression
            <expressions>` that defines when the filter applies to a query. If the
            expression evaluates to ``true`` for an incoming query, {+service-short+} adds
            the :guilabel:`Filter Query` parameters to the incoming query.

            .. include:: /includes/note-filters-no-mongodb-expansions.rst


         .. step:: Specify the Filter Query Predicates

            In the :guilabel:`Query` input box, specify a document that contains
            additional query predicates to merge into the incoming query when the
            filter applies. For example, a filter that withholds documents that
            have a ``score`` below ``20`` could use the following filter query:

            .. code-block:: shell

               { "score": { "$gt": 20 } }

            .. figure:: /images/filters-query.png
               :alt: Filter Query Input Screenshot


         .. step:: Specify the Filter Projection

            In the :guilabel:`Projection` input box, specify a document that
            contains a :manual:`projection
            </tutorial/project-fields-from-query-results>` document to merge into
            the incoming query when the filter applies.

            For example, a filter that withholds the ``career_stats`` and
            ``personal`` fields from documents could use the following filter
            projection:

            .. code-block:: shell

               {
                 "career_stats": 0,
                 "personal": 0
               }

            .. figure:: /images/filters-projection.png
               :alt: Filter Projection Input Screenshot


         .. step:: Save the Filter

            After you have configured the :guilabel:`Filter Query` and the
            :guilabel:`Apply When` expression, click :guilabel:`Save`. After
            saving, {+backend+} immediately begins evaluating and applying filters to
            incoming queries on the collection.

   
   .. tab::
      :tabid: cli
      
      .. procedure::
         :style: normal

         .. step:: Pull the Latest Version of Your App

            To define filters for a collection with {+cli-bin+}, you need a local
            copy of your application's configuration files.

            To pull a local copy of the latest version of your app, run the following:

            .. code-block:: bash

               realm-cli pull --remote="<Your App ID>"

            .. tip::

               You can also download a copy of your application's configuration files from
               the :guilabel:`Deploy > Export App` screen in the {+ui+}.


         .. step:: Add a Rule Configuration File


            To define or modify roles for a collection, open the ``rules.json``
            configuration file within the collection's configuration directory.

            .. tip:: Scaffold the Collection

               If you haven't already defined rules or a schema for the collection, you
               need to manually create its configuration directory and ``schema.json``:

               .. code-block:: bash

                  # Create the collection's configuration directory
                  mkdir -p data_sources/<service>/<db>/<collection>
                  # Create the collection's schema file
                  echo '{}' >> data_sources/<service>/<db>/<collection>/rules.json

            The configuration file should have the following general form:

            .. code-block:: json

               {
                 "database": "<Database Name>",
                 "collection": "<Collection Name>",
                 "roles": [],
                 "filters": []
               }

            .. note::

               This guide focuses on creating ``filters`` for the collection. Check out
               the other configuration guides to learn how to :doc:`define roles and
               permissions </mongodb/define-roles-and-permissions>` and :ref:`enforce
               schemas <enforce-a-schema>`.

            .. include:: /includes/adf-rules-note.rst


         .. step:: Add One or More Filters

            Add a document to the ``filters`` array for each filter that you want
            to configure. Filter documents have the following form:

            .. include:: /mongodb/tables/query-filter-params.rst


         .. step:: Deploy the Updated Rules

            Once you've defined and saved ``rules.json`` you can push the updated config
            to your remote app. {+cli+} immediately deploys the filters on push.

            .. code-block:: bash

               realm-cli push --remote="<Your App ID>"
