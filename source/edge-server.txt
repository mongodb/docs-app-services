.. introduction::

   You have a warehouse, retail store, or another premises where devices 
   need to seamlessly sync their data. Those locations may or may not be 
   online at any given time. Lack of a network connection shouldn't prevent 
   the devices from sharing data with each other.

   Edge Server runs on-premises and handles sync between local devices,
   and bi-directional sync between the Edge Server and Atlas.

   Edge Server is currently in Private Preview. Learn more about previewing
   the 
   `Atlas Device Sync Edge Server <https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/atlas-edge-server>`__.

      Edge server is a local instance of MongoDB paired with a Device Sync 
      server that runs on-premises. It brings real-time sync, disconnection 
      tolerance, and conflict resolution to the location's devices. It 
      seamlessly syncs with Atlas when it has a network connection.

      :icon-alt: An icon depicting data syncing

      Delta Sync ensures that only fields with changes in a document are 
      sent to Atlas. Mission-critical data is transferred efficiently while 
      minimizing network congestion.

      Edge clients can sync and access essential data independently, even 
      when disconnected from the central database. Applications and devices 
      in a connected infrastructure continue to function seamlessly, 
      despite intermittent connectivity.

.. kicker:: How it Works

Edge Server Setup
-----------------

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Create a Device Sync-Enabled App

      Create an :ref:`App Services App <create-app>` with 
      :ref:`Device Sync enabled <enable-sync>`. To get started quickly, 
      :ref:`create a template app <create-template-app>`.

      Once your App is created, coordinate with your Product or Account 
      Representative to enable Edge Server.

   .. step:: Install and Configure the Edge Server

      Configure hardware on-site or a cloud server to host your Edge Server.
      Install the Edge Server on your hardware, complete a basic 
      ``config.json`` with your configuration details, and install required
      dependencies.

      Add an authorization provider, and start the Edge Server.

   .. step:: Connect to the Edge Server from a Client

      Configure your client to connect to the Edge Server instead of directly
      to your Atlas App. Local clients can sync data through the Edge Server
      even without network connectivity. When the Edge Server connects
      with Atlas, it syncs data from the local clients.

      :icon-alt: An icon depicting a user with a shield, representing access

      Built-in user authentication providers include anonymous, 
      email/password, API key, and Custom JWT. A user-based permissions 
      system lets you control who can access which data.

   .. card::
      :headline: Conflict Resolution
      :icon: /images/icons/Technical_REALM_ConflictResolution3x.png
      :icon-alt: An icon depicting conflict resolution

      Edge Server uses the Device Sync engine to handle conflicts. You don't 
      have to write complex custom code to resolve conflicting writes from 
      multiple clients.

      :headline: Reduce Latency
      :icon: /images/icons/Technical_REALM_MobileSync10x.png
      :icon-alt: An icon depicting a mobile device with data synchronization

      Having a local data layer enables rapid synchronization of critical 
      data to edge devices. Reduce latency and enable immediate actions 
      based on real-time insights.
