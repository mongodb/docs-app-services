.. introduction::

   You have a warehouse, retail store, or another premises where devices 
   need to seamlessly sync their data. Those locations may or may not be 
   online at any given time. Lack of a network connection shouldn't prevent 
   the devices from sharing data with each other.

   Edge Server runs on-premises and handles sync between local devices,
   and bi-directional sync between the Edge Server and Atlas.

      :icon-alt: An icon depicting a cloud with a two-way transfer icon

      Edge Server is a local instance of MongoDB paired with a Device Sync 
      server that runs on-premises. It seamlessly syncs with Atlas when it has 
      a network connection.

      :icon-alt: An icon depicting data syncing

      Delta Sync ensures that only fields with changes in a document are 
      sent to Atlas. Mission-critical data is transferred efficiently while 
      minimizing network congestion.

      Edge clients can sync and access essential data independently, even 
      when disconnected from the central database. Applications and devices 
      in a connected infrastructure continue to function seamlessly, 
      despite intermittent connectivity.

.. kicker:: How it Works

Edge Server Setup
-----------------

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Create an Edge Server Service

      You can use Edge Server with MongoDB Drivers and tools in an Edge 
      Server Service. Or you can use Edge Server with Atlas Device SDK to
      develop Sync-enabled mobile and edge applications, and get the
      benefits of conflict resolution and roaming between servers.

      To get started quickly using an Atlas Device SDK mobile app,
      :ref:`create a template app <create-template-app>`. This creates a
      a Device Sync-enabled App with a downloadable client that you can
      use to connect to an Edge Server.

   .. step:: Install and Configure the Edge Server

      Configure hardware on-site or a cloud server to host your Edge Server.
      Use our command line tool ``edgectl`` to install and configure an 
      Edge Server instance on your hardware.

   .. step:: Connect to the Edge Server from a Client

      Connect to an Edge Server with a MongoDB Driver or an Atlas Device SDK
      client. Local clients can sync data through the Edge Server
      even without network connectivity. When the Edge Server connects
      with Atlas, it syncs data from the local clients.

      :icon-alt: An icon depicting a user with a shield, representing access

      Built-in user authentication providers include anonymous, 
      email/password, API key, and Custom JWT. A user-based permissions 
      system lets you control who can access which data.

   .. card::
      :headline: Conflict Resolution
      :icon: /images/icons/Technical_REALM_ConflictResolution3x.png
      :icon-alt: An icon depicting conflict resolution

      Edge Server uses the Device Sync engine to handle conflicts. You don't 
      have to write complex custom code to resolve conflicting writes from 
      multiple Edge Servers. When you pair Edge Server with Atlas Device SDK,
      you get conflict resolution on the clients, too.

      :headline: Reduce Latency
      :icon: /images/icons/Technical_REALM_MobileSync10x.png
      :icon-alt: An icon depicting a mobile device with data synchronization

      Having a local data layer enables rapid synchronization of critical 
      data to edge devices. Reduce latency and enable immediate actions 
      based on real-time insights.
