Overview
--------

You can get up and running with an Atlas App Services App using one of our premade template apps.
Template apps bring together many of the building blocks available in Atlas App Services
and start you off with a prebuilt app that you can customize. You can create 
an app based on a template using any of the following interfaces:

- :ref:`App Services UI <create-a-realm-app>`
- :ref:`{+cli+} <create-app-cli>`
- :ref:`Admin API <create-app-api>`

.. _create-template-app:

Create a Template App
---------------------

You can create a template app using the UI on the Atlas App Services site, 
the Realm CLI, or Admin API. Choose the tab for whichever 
option is most convenient for you.

.. tabs::
   
   .. tab:: Atlas App Services UI
      :tabid: ui

      Follow the procedure described in the 
      :ref:`create-a-realm-app` guide, and select
      the :guilabel:`Create App from Template` tab in the :guilabel:`Create a new App` step. 

      .. _explore-template-app:

      After you create a template app, the UI includes a
      :guilabel:`Welcome to Your Application` section to help you get started
      with services and front-end code. You can:

      1. Learn more about what your chosen template app includes.

      2. Follow on-screen guides to customize your app.

      3. Download the template app client as a .zip file or use {+cli+} to download it.

   .. tab:: {+cli+}
      :tabid: cli

      Follow the procedure described in the 
      :ref:`Create an App with {+cli+} <create-app-cli>` guide and include
      the ``template`` flag followed by one of the template app IDs: 
      
      .. code-block:: shell
         
         realm-cli apps create -n "<App Name>" --template "<Chosen Template App ID>"

   .. tab:: Admin API
      :tabid: api

      Follow the procedure described in the 
      :ref:`Create an App with App Services API <create-app-api>` guide, and select
      the :guilabel:`Template` tab in the :guilabel:`Create a new App` step. 
      When calling the create endpoint you should include a request body that looks like this:

      .. code-block:: json
         
         { 
            "name": "<AppName>",
            "template_id": "<Chosen Template App ID>",
            "data_source": {
               "name": "mongodb-atlas",
               "type": "mongodb-atlas",
               "config": {
                  "clusterName": "<Name Of Existing Cluster>"
               }
            }
         }

.. _get-template-app-client:

Get a Template App Client
-------------------------

Some of the template apps come with working clients to explore and build 
on when creating your applications. You can access these clients in a few
ways:

.. tabs::
   
   .. tab:: Atlas App Services UI
      :tabid: ui
      
      **Download the client when you create the template app**

      When you create a template app using the App Services UI, the UI 
      prompts you with two options to get the client code immediately 
      after creating the template:

      - Download the client code in your preferred programming language 
        as a .zip file.
      - Use the {+cli+} to pull the client code in your preferred programming 
        language.

      Follow the on-screen instructions to get the client code using one 
      of these methods. 

      When you use this method to download your code, the client code is
      pre-populated with your App Services App ID.
      
      **Download the client at some point after creating the template app**

      If you don't download the client code when you first create the app,
      you can come back to this dialogue later. Your App Services App 
      displays a "Welcome to Your Application" pane on the main dashboard. 
      This pane contains a button labeled :guilabel:`</> Pull front-end code`. 
      When you click this button, you see the same dialogue as when you 
      first create an app, which gives you the option to download the client 
      as a .zip or pull it with the {+cli+}.

      When you use this method to download your code, the client code is
      pre-populated with your App Services App ID.

   .. tab:: {+cli+}
      :tabid: cli

      **Download the client when you create the template app**

      When you use {+cli+} to create the template app, it automatically
      creates a directory wherever you run :ref:`the create command 
      <realm-cli-apps-create>` that contains both the backend and client 
      code. Alternately, you can use the ``--local`` option to specify a 
      directory where it should download the app code.
      
      .. code-block:: shell
         
         realm-cli apps create -n "<App Name>" --template "<Chosen Template App ID>"

      The directory name is the name of your app. Inside this directory,
      you'll see a ``backend`` directory that contains the App Services code,
      and a ``frontend`` directory that contains the client application code.

      When you use this method to download your code, the client code is
      pre-populated with your App Services App ID.

      **Download the client at some point after creating the template app**

      At any point after creating a template app, you can use the {+cli+}
      to download the client code. Use the :ref:`{+cli+} pull command 
      <realm-cli-pull>` with the ``--template`` option to specify which 
      client template you want to download.

      .. code-block:: shell
         
         realm-cli pull --remote "<App Name>" --template "<Chosen Template App ID>"

      Use :ref:`the ID of an available template below <template-apps-list>` 
      that offers a client application.

      When you use this method to download your code, the client code is
      pre-populated with your App Services App ID.

   .. tab:: GitHub
      :tabid: github

      The Device Sync template app clients are available in GitHub. If you
      want just the client code without the backend code, explore the 
      relevant GitHub repository for your preferred framework or language:

      - :github:`Flutter Device Sync Client <mongodb/template-app-dart-flutter-todo>`
      - :github:`Kotlin Device Sync Client <mongodb/template-app-kotlin-todo>`
      - :github:`React Native Device Sync Client <mongodb/template-app-react-native-todo>`
      - :github:`SwiftUI Device Sync Client <mongodb/template-app-swiftui-todo>`
      - :github:`Xamarin Device Sync Client <mongodb/template-app-xamarin-todo>`

      If you clone one of these repositories, the client code is not 
      pre-populated with your App Services App ID. To use one of these
      clients, you must :ref:`create a template app <create-template-app>` 
      and :ref:`find your App ID <find-your-app-id>` to use in the client.
      Follow the :guilabel:`Configuration` and :guilabel:`Cloning from GitHub` 
      instructions in the client :file:`README.md` to learn where to insert 
      your App ID.
