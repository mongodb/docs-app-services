Overview
--------

This page contains workarounds for known issues you may encounter while
developing with {+service+}.

.. note:: Issue and Feature Tracking

   If you have suggestions for the product itself or wish to track
   existing feature ideas, please check out the `official MongoDB
   feedback site <https://feedback.mongodb.com/forums/923521-realm/>`_.

Sync
----

Sync fails to enable shortly after cluster creation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Enabling {+sync+} on a newly-created cluster may fail with an error
message about parsing the URI. This happens because an SRV record hasn't
propagated yet. While we work to provide more helpful diagnostics around
this issue, there are two possible workarounds:

- Wait five minutes, then enable {+sync+}.
- Unlink and :ref:`re-link the cluster <link-a-data-source>`.

Triggers
--------

Change Stream History Lost
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a Database Trigger tries to process an event that has fallen off the
:manual:`oplog </core/replica-set-oplog/>`, the Trigger becomes
suspended. When a ``ChangeStreamHistoryLost`` error
occurs, the following description appears in the App logs:

.. code-block::
   :copyable: false

   (ChangeStreamHistoryLost) Resume of change stream was not possible,
   as the resume point may no longer be in the oplog.

You can :manual:`restart <changeStreams/#resume-tokens>` the Trigger, but
the Trigger will not process any events between the last processed event
and the time that you restart the Trigger.

   - For more information, refer to :ref:`Suspended Triggers <suspended_triggers>`.
   - If you frequently see this error, consider
     :ref:`Disabling event ordering <database-triggers-disable-event-ordering>`.
