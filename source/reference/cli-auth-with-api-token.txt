Overview
--------

MongoDB provides the {+service-short+} Command Line Interface (``realm-cli``) to manage
your App Services apps programmatically. You can authenticate a MongoDB Cloud
User with an API key for your project. Generate an API key through the
access manager in your MongoDB Cloud account.
