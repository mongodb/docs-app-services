App Services provides a variety of metrics related to App Services and Device
Sync. You can access your metrics data with the Admin API's
:admin-api-endpoint:`getMetrics <tag/metrics/operation/adminGetMetrics>` endpoint.

The content on this page is provided for your information. The exact metrics
returned may be subject to change.

Units
-----

App Services expresses each metric in one of the following units:

- BYTES_PER_SECOND
- MILLISECONDS
- SCALAR
- SCALAR_PER_SECOND

A **scalar** is a singular value representing a magnitude or count. Its exact
interpretation depends on the metric.

A **scalar per second** represents a count over time ("rate"). The value is
effectively the total count in the requested time window divided by the number
of seconds in the window.

Some scalar per second values are expressed as a 95th percentile. This means
that the reading for the given metric is below the given value 95% of the time
and above it the other 5% of the time.
