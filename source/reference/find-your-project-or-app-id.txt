Find a Project ID
-----------------
The following steps guide you through finding your ``Project ID``, also 
known as a ``Group ID``.

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This procedure assumes you have already created a MongoDB Atlas Project. If
you do not yet have a project, :atlas:`Create a Project
</tutorial/manage-projects/#create-a-project>`.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

Navigate to Your Atlas Cluster
``````````````````````````````

Log into your :mms-home:`MongoDB Atlas <>` account to view your projects.

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Select the Organization That Contains the Project You Want


      In the upper left-hand corner of your Atlas Dashboard, you'll see
      a drop-down menu that contains the Organizations you can access. Select
      the Organization that contains the Project you'd like to view.

The following steps guide you through finding your App ID.

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Before you begin, you will need to create an App. If
you haven't already, read the :ref:`Create an App
<create-an-app>` doc.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

Navigate to Your App
````````````````````

Log into your `App Services <https://realm.mongodb.com?tck=docs_realm>`_
console to view your App Services Apps. 

.. procedure::

   .. step:: View Your App In The App Console


      The App Services Admin Console will allow you to view all of the
      applications you have created. There you can navigate to the dashboard
      of a specific app. To begin, log into
      `App Services <https://realm.mongodb.com?tck=docs_realm>`_ to view your
      App Services App. Click your App to enter its dashboard.

   .. step:: Copy Your App ID


      Your app ID is used to connect to your App from
      the Client SDKs. To copy your App ID, click the :guilabel:`copy`
      button on the left hand side of your application dashboard.

      .. note::

          The UI displays your app name in the top left. When you click the
          copy button, the UI copies your app ID, not your app name, into
          your clipboard. For example, the UI would display the name
          "exampleApp" but copy the id "exampleApp-wlkgs".
