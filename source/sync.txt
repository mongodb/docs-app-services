.. introduction::

   You're developing a mobile app. Your users want their data saved in the cloud
   and accessible from their other devices. Network access on a mobile device
   can be intermittent, so you write data locally on the device first. A
   background process then synchronizes the data to the cloud and resolves any
   conflicting writes.
 
   Atlas Device Sync provides all of the above, so you can build better apps faster.

      Atlas Device Sync is a bridge between client apps using the :realm:`Realm SDKs </>`
      and a MongoDB instance running in Atlas. Realm is a lightweight database
      optimized for mobile development.

   .. card::

      :icon: /images/icons/Technical_REALM_ConflictResolution3x.png
      :icon-alt: An icon depicting conflict resolution

      Device Sync handles conflicts for you, so you don't have to write
      complex custom code to resolve conflicting writes from multiple clients.
      A user-based permissions system lets you control who can access which data.

      Realm Database and Device Sync seamlessly handle intermittent
      connectivity so users can continue using your app regardless of their
      current network status.

      The best way to start using Device Sync is with a template starter app.
      In the Atlas App Services UI, under the :guilabel:`App Services` tab, you can select a
      template. Atlas configures a backend instance and gives you the
      frontend code for a selection of platforms.

      The mobile app tutorials guide you through building a feature on top of a
      template starter app with Atlas Device Sync.

Explore the Device Sync Documentation
-------------------------------------

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Maintain Data Integrity with Schemas

      Define your application data model with standard schemas that you can use
      to validate data and generate language-specific classes. Read the
      :ref:`sync-schema-overview` to get oriented.

   .. step:: Configure & Enable Device Sync

      Whether you based your app on one of our template apps or started from
      scratch, at some point you'll want to configure Sync specially for your
      needs. Read more: :ref:`enable-sync`.

   .. step:: Protect User Data with Permissions

      Device Sync provides a user-based permissions system that lets you
      control who can access which data. To learn how to set up permissions for
      a variety of real use cases, check out the
      :ref:`flexible-sync-permissions-guide`.

   .. step:: Handle Errors

      Develop a robust app that can handle schema changes and data recovery
      scenarios with the :ref:`client-resets` documentation. Troubleshoot other
      errors and edge cases with the :ref:`sync-errors` reference. 

   .. step:: Go to Production

      Test your app under a simulated load with the
      :ref:`sync-production-load-testing` guide, then get your app ready to ship
      with the :ref:`sync-production-checklist`. To understand how costs scale
      with usage beyond the free tier, refer to the :ref:`billing` page.

      Encrypt sensitive data in Realm Database files with the encryption APIs.

      Built-in user authentication providers include anonymous, email/password,
      API key, Custom Function, Custom JWT, Facebook, Google, and Apple.

      Device Sync encrypts all network traffic using Transport Layer Security
      (TLS). Document and field-level permissions determine which data may be
      synced to the device.
