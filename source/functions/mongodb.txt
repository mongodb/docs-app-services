As part of the deprecation of Atlas App Services, the ability to query MongoDB
Atlas through Functions will only be available through Triggers. The Query
MongoDB Atlas documentation has been moved to
`MongoDB Atlas Documentation -> Triggers/Functions
<https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-ui/triggers/functions/>`__.

For more details, refer to :ref:`app-services-deprecation`.
