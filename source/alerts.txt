Introduction
------------
{+atlas+} provides an Activity Feed that displays events for each 
:atlas:`project </organizations-projects/#std-label-projects>`. Atlas App Services
activities are included in this feed. To view and/or download only 
App Services events, you can specify a filter, as described below.

Project Activity Feed
---------------------
There are two ways to access the Project Activity Feed: through the 
{+atlas-short+} UI, and through the Atlas API. The following {+atlas-short+} 
documentation pages describe each approach:

- :atlas:`View Activity Feed in the UI </tutorial/activity-feed/>`
- :atlas:`Get All Project Events through the API </reference/api/events-projects-get-all/>`

Filter Activities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

App Services activities are a subset of 
:atlas:`{+atlas-short+} alerts </alerts/>`. You can filter the Project Activity 
Feed results to show only App Services events, or a subset of 
App Services events. To do this, click the 
:guilabel:`Filter by event(s)` menu and check :guilabel:`App Services`. In the 
right-hand side of the menu, you will see 
all App Services events selected. Deselect any that you do not want to see. 
The feed list automatically updates with each change you make.

.. note:: Filtering By App Services Application

   The Activity Feed does not support filtering events by App Services 
   application, but each event (and its corresponding alert) provides context 
   and routing information for the appropriate application.

The **Category** for 
all App Services activities is "App Services"; within that category, there are 
several **Events**:

   * - :ref:`Deployment <application-deployment>` 
     - Successful Deploy
     - A user (or Code Deployment) deployment has succeeded 
   
   * - :ref:`Deployment <application-deployment>` 
     - Deployment Failure
     - A user (or Code Deployment) deployment has failed 
   
   * - :ref:`Limit <mongodb-service-limitations-request-traffic>`
     - Request Rate Limit
     - An overall request rate limit was hit


App Services Alerts
-------------------
There are default alerts that map to three of the activities listed above. In 
addition, you can create custom alerts for the other App Services 
activities.

Default Alerts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Default App Services alerts trigger a notification and email to the 
Project Owners. The three default App Services alerts occur when:

- An Atlas Device Sync process fails and cannot be restarted

- A trigger fails and cannot be restarted

- An App Services application hits an overall request rate limit

Custom App Services Alerts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For any activity that is not mapped to a default alert, you can set a custom 
alert at the Project level.

You create App Services alerts in the same way you :atlas:`create other 
{+atlas-short+} alerts </configure-alerts/>`. When creating a new alert, in the 
":guilabel:`Alert if`" section, select :guilabel:`App Services` from the 
:guilabel:`Target`.
