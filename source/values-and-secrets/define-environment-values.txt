Define Environment Values
=========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

You can define :ref:`environment values <environment-values>` directly in the
Atlas App Services UI or by importing :ref:`environment configuration files
<appconfig-environment>` with :ref:`{+cli+} <deploy-cli>` or :ref:`GitHub
<deploy-github>`.

You can access defined environment values through :ref:`function context
<context-environment>` and in :json-expansion:`rule expressions
<%%environment>`.

Procedure

      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Create a New Value

            In the App Services UI, click :guilabel:`Values` in the {+leftnav+} and then click
            :guilabel:`Create New Value`. Enter a name for the value and select
            :guilabel:`Environment` for the value type.


         .. step:: Define Values for Each Environment

            Define a value for each environment that you want to access the value from.
            You can define a different value for each environment and may leave a value
            undefined in any environment.

         .. step:: Specify Your App Environment

            Your app always runs in a specific environment, which affects the value of all
            environment values. You can specify the current environment for your app on
            the :guilabel:`Deploy > Environment` screen.

         .. step:: Save and Deploy

            Once you've defined the environment value, click :guilabel:`Save` to update
            the configuration. If your application has deployment drafts enabled, click
            :guilabel:`Review & Deploy` to deploy the changes.

   
   .. tab::
      :tabid: cli
      
      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Pull Your App

            To define environment variables with the {+cli-ref+}, you need a local copy of
            your application's :ref:`configuration files <app-configuration>`.

            To pull a local copy of the latest version of your app, run the following
            command while logged in to the {+cli+}:

            .. code-block:: bash

               {+cli-bin+} pull --remote="<Your App ID>"

            .. tip::

               You can also download a copy of your application's configuration files from
               the :guilabel:`Deploy > Import/Export App` screen in the App Services UI.


         .. step:: Modify One or More Environments

            The ``/environments`` directory contains ``.json`` files for every supported
            environment tag. Each file defines all of the environment values for its
            corresponding environment.

            App Services supports the following environment tags:

            .. include:: /includes/list-of-environment-names.rst

            Open the file for each environment where the value should be defined. In each
            file, add an entry to the ``values`` subdocument that maps the value's name to
            its value in that environment.

            .. example::

               The following configurations define the ``baseUrl`` environment value in
               the ``production`` and ``development`` environments.

               .. code-block:: json
                  :caption: /environments/production.json

                  {
                    "values": {
                      "baseUrl": "https://example.com"
                    }
                  }

               .. code-block:: json
                  :caption: /environments/development.json

                  {
                    "values": {
                      "baseUrl": "https://dev.example.com"
                    }
                  }


         .. step:: Specify Your App Environment

            Your app always runs in a specific environment, which affects the value of all
            environment values. You can specify the current environment for your app in
            ``realm_config.json``:

            .. code-block:: json
               :caption: realm_config.json

               {
                 "environment": "development"
               }


         .. step:: Deploy the Environment Values

            Once you've defined values for each environment, you can push the updated
            configurations to your remote app. {+cli+} immediately deploys the update
            environment values on push.

            .. code-block:: bash

               {+cli-bin+} push --remote="<Your App ID>"
