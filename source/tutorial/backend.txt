Overview
--------

*Estimated time to complete: 30 minutes*

In this tutorial, you will use {+service+} to build a serverless
application that monitors GitHub repositories and tracks contributions.

The app that you build will have several features:

- Keep track of users that have contributed to your project in a MongoDB Atlas collection.

- Leave a comment that welcomes new contributors when they open a pull request or file an issue.

- Generate and send a weekly report that summarizes contributions to your repository.

After completing this tutorial, you will know how to do the following tasks:

- Write and run serverless :ref:`functions <functions>` that handle your app's logic.

- Automate scheduled tasks and respond to changing data with :ref:`triggers <triggers>`.

- Store and access static data, like API keys, in :ref:`values <values-and-secrets>`.

- Connect to an external service through an API

Before You Start
----------------

You'll need to have the following before you can begin this tutorial:

- A GitHub repository. The app you build will track contributions to
  this repository. You can `create a new repository
  <https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository>`__
  for this tutorial or use an existing repo that you have admin access
  to.

- A MongoDB Atlas cluster. If you don't already have a cluster, `sign up
  for MongoDB Atlas and create one for free
  <https://account.mongodb.com/account/register?tck=docs_realm>`__.

Also note that this tutorial doesn't use the Deployment Draft workflow. Unless you have disabled 
Deployment Drafts, you may need to save your changes to a draft and then deploy them manually.

Create a New {+app+}
----------------

First, you'll need to create an application in {+service-short+}. If you see a prompt about 
Aplication Guides, select :guilabel:`Close Guides`.

To create the app:

1. Open your Atlas project at `cloud.mongodb.com <https://cloud.mongodb.com?tck=docs_realm>`__.

#. In the top navigation, click :guilabel:`{+service-short+}`.

#. Click :guilabel:`Create a New App`.

#. Name the app ``github-tracker-tutorial``.

#. Select your cluster to link it to the new app.

#. Click :guilabel:`Create App Service`.

   :alt: The app creation screen with the app name set to "github-tracker-tutorial".

Welcome New GitHub Contributors
-------------------------------

We'll connect the {+app+} to your GitHub repository using a `GitHub
repository webhook
<https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/about-webhooks>`__.
Webhooks let your app know whenever some event, like a new commit or
pull request, happens in your repository. Each event runs a serverless
function where you can do something in response.

For this tutorial, we'll use the `GitHub REST API
<https://docs.github.com/en/rest>`__ to send a welcome message to
contributors whenever they open their first pull request or issue on a
repository.

Create an Endpoint
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Webhooks work by sending a request about the event to a URL that your
app controls. In your app, you'll need to expose a custom endpoint with
a unique URL to receive and handle the webhook requests.

To create the endpoint:

1. In the {+leftnav+}, click :guilabel:`HTTPS Endpoints`.

#. Click :guilabel:`Add An Endpoint`.

#. Name the endpoint route ``/greetNewContributors``.

#. Leave the HTTP method set to **POST**.

#. For authorization, choose :guilabel:`Require a Secret`. 

#. Enter a new secret name and click :guilabel:`Create` to create a new secret, then enter
   ``tutorial`` as the secret value. This requires all incoming requests
   to include the query parameter ``secret=tutorial`` in the request
   URL.

#. Create a new :ref:`Atlas Function <functions>` for the endpoint and name it
   ``endpoints/greetNewContributors``.
   
#. For now, set up a basic handler that only responds to incoming calls
   without doing other work. Copy the following code into the function
   body:

   .. code-block:: javascript
      
      exports = async function greetNewContributors(request, response) {
        return response
          .setStatusCode(200)
          .setBody("Successfully received a GitHub webhook event")
      }

#. Click :guilabel:`Save` and deploy the endpoint.

#. Under :guilabel:`Operation Type`, copy the endpoint callback URL. You'll need it 
to set up the GitHub webhook later.

.. _function-authentication-settings:

Update Your Endpoint Function's Authentication Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Now that you've created the endpoint in your app, you need to change the authentication
settings so that the GitHub webhook is accepted.

To update your function's authentication settings:

1. In the {+leftnav+}, click :guilabel:`Functions`.

#. Find your endpoing function and select it.

#. Click :guilabel:`Settings`.

#. Under :guilabel:`Authentication`, change the authentication method to :guilabel:`System`.

Connect the Endpoint to a GitHub Webhook
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With , you need to set up a
webhook in your GitHub repository that sends events to the endpoint.

To create the webhook in your repository:
   
1. Open the repository's settings and select :guilabel:`Webhooks` in the
   {+leftnav+}.

#. `Add a new webhook <https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/creating-webhooks#setting-up-a-webhook>`__ 
   and set the :guilabel:`Payload URL` to the URL of the endpoint that you just created. 
   The URL will look like one of the following depending on your app's :doc:`deployment 
   model </manage-apps/deploy/deployment-models-and-regions>`:
   
   .. tabs::
      
      .. tab:: Global Apps
         :tabid: global

         .. code-block:: text
            
            https://data.mongodb-api.com/app/<App ID>/endpoint/greetNewContributors
      
      .. tab:: Local Apps
         :tabid: local

         .. code-block:: text
            
            https://<Region>.aws.data.mongodb-api.com/app/<App ID>/endpoint/greetNewContributors

#. Set the webhook content type to :guilabel:`application/json`.

#. Set the :guilabel:`Secret` to the same secret value you defined for
   the endpoint: ``tutorial``.

#. Choose to select individual events and configure the webhook to only
   send events for :guilabel:`Issues` and :guilabel:`Pull requests`.

#. Click :guilabel:`Add webhook` to save the new webhook.
   
To confirm that the webhook succesfully calls your endpoint, check your :ref:`application logs <logs>` 
for entries with the type ``Endpoint``. You can also check the `webhook's request logs
<https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/testing-webhooks>`__
in GitHub under :guilabel:`Recent Deliveries` on the webhook's settings page. Each successful 
request has a green checkmark next to it.

.. figure:: /images/github-tutorial-successful-webhook-delivery-1.png
   :alt: A log entry in GitHub that shows the custom endpoint's response to a ping event. 
   The response has a status code of 200 and the response body says "Successfully received 
   a GitHub webhook event".

Get a GitHub Access Token
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The webhook is now set up to send events from GitHub to your endpoint.
However, to respond to events in the endpoint with the GitHub API you'll
need an access token. This tutorial uses personal access tokens, but you
could also set up a GitHub app and use that token instead.

To `create a personal access token
<https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token>`__:

1. Open your GitHub user settings (not your repository settings) and
   select :guilabel:`Developer settings` in the {+leftnav+}.

#. In the {+leftnav+}, select :guilabel:`Personal access tokens` and then
   click :guilabel:`Generate new token`.

#. Configure the token with a descriptive name and a reasonable
   expiration time. Since this is a tutorial, consider expiring the
   token after 7 days.

#. Select the ``repo`` scope.

#. Click :guilabel:`Generate token`.

#. Copy the token somewhere secure where you can access it again. GitHub
   will never show you the token again after this point.

Store the Token as a Value
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Back in your app, add a new value to hold the personal access token you
just generated. You'll be able to reference the value from your endpoint
without hardcoding the token into your functions.

To create the value:

1. In the {+leftnav+}, click :guilabel:`Values`.

#. Click :guilabel:`Create New Value`.

#. Name the value ``GitHubAccessToken``.

#. Leave the type set to :guilabel:`Value`.

#. Paste the personal access token into the value's content input. Note that the 
value must be valid JSON, so ensure you have surrounding quotation marks.

#. Click :guilabel:`Save`.

Install the GitHub API Client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The endpoint will interact with GitHub's REST API to leave comments. You
could write and send HTTP requests directly to the API using the
built-in ``context.http`` client or an external library. However, in
this tutorial we use GitHub's official Node.js library called
:github:`Octokit <octokit/core.js>` that wraps the API. Once installed,
you'll be able to import the library from any function in your app.

To add the Octokit library to your app:

1. In the {+leftnav+}, click :guilabel:`Functions`.

#. Select the :guilabel:`Dependencies` tab.

#. Click :guilabel:`Add Dependency`.

#. Enter the package name: ``@octokit/request``.

#. Click :guilabel:`Add`.

#. Wait for {+service-short+} to install the package. The installation should
   complete in a few seconds, but may take up to a minute.

Write the Endpoint Logic
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now that you have an access token and have installed Octokit, you can
update the endpoint function to actually do something when it receives
events. Specifically, the function should:

- Parse the incoming webhook event
- Log the contribution in MongoDB
- Add a comment through the GitHub API
- Send an informative response back to GitHub

To update the function:

1. In the {+leftnav+}, click :guilabel:`Functions`.

#. Click :guilabel:`endpoints/greetNewContributors` to open the endpoint
   function editor.

#. Replace the basic function with the following code:
   
   .. literalinclude:: /tutorial/backend-examples/greetNewContributors.js
      :language: javascript
      :caption: functions/endpoints/greetNewContributors.js

#. Click :guilabel:`Save` and deploy the endpoint.

Test the Endpoint
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The welcome message endpoint should now be fully set up. To test that it
works correctly, open a new issue or pull request on the repository. The
endpoint will add a new comment to the thread the first time you do this
but won't add a welcome message on subsequent attempts.

.. figure:: /images/github-tutorial-issue-comment.png
   :alt: An example of the welcome comment in GitHub added by the endpoint.

GitHub logs repository webhook requests, so you can also check the log
entry in GitHub to confirm that everything is working properly. Each
request log includes a response message from the endpoint.

.. figure:: /images/github-tutorial-successful-webhook-delivery-2.png
   :alt: A log entry in GitHub that shows the custom endpoint's response for a first-time contributor

.. tip::
   
   If you want to reset the test, delete the document with your GitHub
   username from ``community.contributions``. This lets the app "forget"
   that you've contributed before and it will welcome you on your next
   contribution.

Generate a Weekly Community Report
----------------------------------

Your app is connected to GitHub, stores information about contributions,
and welcomes new contributors. Now we'll extend it to automatically
analyze and generate reports for your repository.

Specify Which Repos Should Generate Reports
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your app needs a way to know which repositories it should generate
reports for every week. For this tutorial, we'll hardcode the list in a
value.

Create a new value called ``GitHubProjects`` that contains an array of
objects. Each object specifies the ``owner`` and ``repo`` name of a
GitHub repository. Make sure to include an entry for your repository.

.. code-block:: json
   :caption: values/projects.json
   
   [
     { "owner": "<GitHub Username>", "repo": "<Repository Name>" }
   ]

Create a Function that Generates Reports
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A report is a document that summarizes the contributions to a repository
for some time period. We'll use a function to create on-demand reports
for a repo.

Create a new function named ``generateCommunityReport`` and add the
following code:

.. literalinclude:: /tutorial/backend-examples/generateCommunityReport.js
   :language: javascript
   :caption: functions/generateCommunityReport.js

Generate And Save Reports Every Week
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The function you just created creates a report for a repository
on-demand. However, at this point nothing calls the function and the
generated reports are not saved anywhere. To actually use it, we'll
create a scheduled trigger that calls the function once every week and
saves the generated reports in your linked cluster.

To create the trigger:

1. In the {+leftnav+}, click :guilabel:`Triggers`.

#. Click :guilabel:`Add a Trigger`.

#. Choose :guilabel:`Scheduled` for the trigger type.

#. Name the trigger ``generateAndSaveCommunityReports``

#. Choose the :guilabel:`Advanced` schedule type

#. Enter the following cron schedule to run once a week on Monday at 5
   AM UTC:

   .. code-block:: text

      0 5 * * 1

#. Create a new function for the trigger and name it
   ``triggers/generateAndSaveCommunityReports``.

#. Click :guilabel:`Add Dependency` and install ``moment``, which we use
   to work with dates in the function.

#. Copy the following code into the function body:
   
   .. literalinclude:: /tutorial/backend-examples/generateAndSaveCommunityReports.js
      :language: javascript
      :caption: functions/triggers/generateAndSaveCommunityReports.js

#. Click :guilabel:`Save`.

#. Update your new function's :ref:`authentication settings <function-authentication-settings>` 
to match the new endpoint function from earlier in this tutorial.

Send Report Notifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your app will now automatically generate and save reports every week.
However, the reports won't be very useful if nobody sees them. We'll
create a database trigger that listens for new reports and creates a
formatted message that you can send to end users.

To set up the messages:

1. In the {+leftnav+}, click :guilabel:`Triggers`.

#. Click :guilabel:`Add a Trigger`.

#. Leave the trigger type set to :guilabel:`Database`.

#. Name the trigger ``sendCommunityReport``.

#. Add the trigger to the ``community.reports`` collection and listen
   for :guilabel:`Insert` events.

#. Enable :guilabel:`Full Document` to include each new report document
   in the change event passed to the trigger function.

#. Create a new function for the trigger and name it
   ``triggers/sendCommunityReport``.
   
#. Copy the following code into the function body:
   
   .. literalinclude:: /tutorial/backend-examples/sendCommunityReport.js
      :language: javascript
      :caption: functions/triggers/sendCommunityReport.js

#. Click :guilabel:`Save` and deploy the trigger.

Test the Report Triggers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your app is set up to automatically generate, save, and send reports
every week. To make sure that everything works, you can run this report
flow manually.

Open the function editor for your scheduled trigger,
``triggers/generateAndSaveCommunityReports``, and then click the
:guilabel:`Run` button. This should generate and save on-demand reports
for every repo that you listed in the ``GitHubProjects`` value.

To confirm: 

1. Check ``community.reports`` for the new report documents.

2. Check your application's database trigger logs to find the formatted
   message for each report

What's Next?
------------

Congratulations! You've succesfully set up a serverless GitHub
contribution tracker and reached the end of this tutorial.

Keep Building
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to keep developing, you can try to add some new features to
the tracker. For example, you could:

- Update the endpoint to handle more webhook event types like
  `issue_comment
  <https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads#issue_comment>`__ or 
  `pull_request_review
  <https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads#pull_request_review>`__.

- Update the weekly reports to include more information from the GitHub
  API.

- Connect to an external service like :twilio:`Twilio <>` or `SendGrid
  <https://sendgrid.com/>`__ to actually send the report via email or
  SMS instead of just logging it.
