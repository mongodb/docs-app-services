Overview
--------

You can use the Realm React Native SDK and :npm:`@realm/react`
to build a mobile application with React Native. This tutorial
walks you through how to build your own app that uses Flexible Sync.

For this tutorial, we'll start with a pre-built TypeScript template application
to see how everything fits together. 

After you've got the template app running, you will add a new ``priority``
field to the existing ``Item`` model and update the Flexible Sync
Subscription to only show items within a range of priorities. This example 
illustrates how you might adapt the template app for your own needs. 
You would not necessarily make this change given the current structure of 
the template app.

The template app provides a toggle that simulates the device being in 
an offline mode. This toggle lets you quickly test Device Sync functionality,
emulating the user having no internet connection. However,
you would likely remove this toggle in a production application.

This tutorial should take around 30 minutes.

.. note:: Check Out the Quick Start
   
   If you prefer to explore on your own rather than follow a guided
   tutorial, check out the :ref:`React Native Quick Start
   <react-native-client-quick-start>`. It includes copyable code
   examples and the essential information that you need to set up a
   React Native app with Atlas Device Sync.

Prerequisites
-------------

- You must set up your local environment for React Native development
  before you can begin this tutorial. For detailed instructions, see
  `Setting up the development environment
  <https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup>`_ in the React Native
  docs.

Start with the Template App
---------------------------

To start, you'll create a new app on your computer and get familiar with
it. The app is a pre-built template that includes a working React
Native application and its corresponding Atlas App configuration files.

The template app is a basic to-do list application that lets users do various
things to manage their tasks.

- Create email/password accounts and log in and out of the app.
- Create, read, update, and delete their own tasks.
- View all tasks, even where the user is not the owner.

Use the following steps to get the template app up and running on your
computer:

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Create the Template App
      
      Run the following command in a terminal to create a new folder
      with your templated configuration files and React Native app:
      
      .. code-block:: shell
         
         npx mongodb-realm-cli apps create \
           --template react-native.todo.flex \
           --name realm-sync-tutorial
         
      The command creates a new folder in your current directory with
      the same name as the value of the ``--name`` flag.
   
   .. step:: Install Dependencies

      In your terminal, run the following commands to navigate to the
      React Native app and install its dependencies:

      .. code-block:: shell

         cd realm-sync-tutorial/frontend/react-native.todo.flex
         npm install
      
      To build and run the app on an iOS device or simulator, install
      the additional iOS dependencies with `CocoaPods
      <https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html>`__.

      .. code-block:: shell
         
         npx pod-install
      
      .. tip::

         Make sure to switch back to the frontend project's root
         directory after you install the pods.

   .. step:: Build the App

      At this point, you should have a fully functional React Native app
      that can run on both iOS and Android.

      .. tabs::

         .. tab:: iOS
            :tabid: ios

            To make sure that everything works on iOS, build the app and
            run it in an iOS simulator:
            
            .. code-block:: shell

               npm run ios

         .. tab:: Android
            :tabid: android
            
            To make sure that everything works on Android:
            
            1. Start an Android emulator. See :android:`Run apps on the
               Android Emulator <studio/run/emulator>` for details on
               how to do this.
            
            2. Build the app on the emulator:
               
               .. code-block:: shell
                  
                  npm run android

      .. tip::
         
         If you're encountering an error or otherwise having issues,
         it's likely an issue with how your local environment is set up.
         Check out the official React Native
         `development environment setup
         <https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup>`_
         guide and ensure that you've followed all the steps for
         your Development OS and Target OS.

   .. step:: Test the App
      
      When the build completes, you should have a functional app running
      on your simulator. In the app, register a new account and test the features:

      - Add a few to-do items to the list.
      - Press the checkbox on one or two items to mark them as complete.
      - Press the X on an item to delete it from the list.
      - Toggle internet connectivity in the app to simulate offline mode.

      If you connect to your Atlas cluster and query the
      ``todo.Item`` collection you can see your App's data. As long as it's not
      in offline mode, new data and changes from the React Native app automatically 
      sync to this collection.

      .. tip::

         To learn how to connect to your Atlas cluster, see
         :ref:`atlas-connect-to-deployment`.
       
      Similarly, any changes in the collection automatically sync down
      to the React Native app. Try changing an item's completion status
      in your cluster - the React Native app will automatically update
      with the new value whenever there is a network connection
      available.

      .. tip::

         To learn more about updating data in your cluster, see
         :ref:`write-op-update`.

Get Familiar With the Template App
----------------------------------

Now that you have the template app running let's dive into the code to
see what we're working with.

Atlas App
~~~~~~~~~

The template app includes a fully configured Atlas App in the
``backend`` directory. It has a unique ``app_id`` value in
``realm_config.json`` that client applications use to connect.

It also includes the following pre-defined configurations:

- A data source linked to your Atlas Cluster.

- A schema for the ``todo.Item`` collection that matches the ``Item``
  class in the React Native app.

- An authentication provider that lets users register for and log in to
  your app with an email and password.

- A flexible sync configuration with a single session role that allows
  users to read and write their own items and view other users' items.

React Native App
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The React Native app is a fully configured mobile client that can run on
iOS and Android devices. It is located in the
``frontend/react-native.todo.flex`` directory.

The app uses the official :npm:`@realm/react` library. The library
includes React hooks and components that let you connect to your Atlas
App, read and write data, and automatically sync changes from other
devices.

The app contains some configuration files and directories, but you can
ignore those unless you want to customize the app. For this tutorial,
you'll want to be familiar with the React components in the ``src/``
directory:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - File Name
       
     - Description
     
   * - ``ItemSchema.tsx``
       
     - The ``Item`` class, including its object schema. We import this
       class in ``RealmContext.ts`` to include it in the app's Realm
       schema.
     
   * - ``RealmContext.ts``
       
     - The Realm hooks and providers that we create and export to work
       with Realm throughout the app.
     
   * - ``App.tsx``
       
     - The root component of the app, which we wrap with the Realm hook
       providers from ``RealmContext.ts``.
     
   * - ``WelcomeView.tsx``
       
     - The user registration and login form that users see when they
       first open the app.
     
   * - ``ItemListView.tsx``
       
     - The main to-do list app that users interact with after they log
       in. It queries for ``Item`` Realm objects and displays them
       in a list. It also includes the code to create new ``Item``
       objects and store them in Realm.
     
   * - ``CreateToDoPrompt.tsx``
       
     - A UI form that lets us enter data for new ``Item`` objects. The
       code that actually creates new objects is in ``ItemListView.tsx``.
     
   * - ``LogoutButton.tsx``
       
     - A reusable button that logs out an authenticated user.

Add a Priority Level Field
--------------------------

Now that you're more familiar with what's already provided in the
template app, let's write some code to implement a new feature.

For this tutorial, we'll add a new "priority" property to each of the
``Item`` objects. This will let us organize to-dos by how important they
are and allow us to focus only on the most important ones.

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Define the Priority Levels
      
      We want to allow a small number of named priority levels, and we
      want to easily be able sort the levels. To do this, we'll use a
      helper function to define an "enum" object that maps a set of
      ordered level names to and from an integer that represents their
      priority.
      
      Add the following code directly under the import statements in
      ``src/ItemSchema.tsx``:

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/react-native/ItemSchema.snippet.create-priority-enum.tsx
        :language: javascript
      
      The priority levels in the enum are ordered from most important
      to least. The corresponding index value for each level increases
      from the most important, ``Priority[0]``, to the least important,
      ``Priority[3]``. This means that a "higher" priority level (i.e. a
      more important one) has a lower index value.
   
   .. step:: Update the To-Do Item Data Model

      Now we have an ``enum`` that defines the possible values of the
      ``priority`` field. However, we still have to define the
      ``priority`` field in the ``Item`` class.

      Add the following lines to your code in ``src/ItemSchema.tsx`` to
      add ``priority`` to the model:

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/react-native/ItemSchema.snippet.define-item-class.tsx
        :language: javascript
        :caption: src/ItemSchema.tsx
        :emphasize-lines: 6, 18-22
      
      .. note:: Why Didn't This Break Sync

         At this point, your React Native ``Item`` model and its
         corresponding schema in your Atlas App no longer agree. That's
         okay!

         Adding a property to a Realm object is not a breaking change
         and therefore does not require a :ref:`client reset
         <client-resets>`. The template app has Development Mode
         enabled, so changes to the client Realm object are reflected in
         the server-side schema. For more information, see
         :ref:`<development-mode>` and
         :ref:`<additive-changes-synced-schema>`.

   .. step:: Add a Priority Picker

      Your app's data model now includes a ``priority`` for each ``Item``
      object. Let's update the app UI so that you can choose a priority
      value when you add a new to-do to the list.
      
      First, we'll install an external library to implement the priority
      picker component. Run the following in your terminal inside of
      your project root:
      
      .. code-block:: shell
         
         npm install @react-native-picker/picker
      
      If you're building for iOS, make sure to link the associated
      Cocoapods after you've installed the package:

      .. code-block:: shell

         npx pod-install
      
      .. tip::
         
         You may need to rebuild your app after installing. To do so,
         stop the bundler for your project and then run the build
         command:

         .. tabs::
            
            .. tab:: iOS
               :tabid: ios
   
               .. code-block:: shell
                  
                  npm run ios
            
            .. tab:: Android
               :tabid: android
   
               .. code-block:: shell
                  
                  npm run android
      
      Now that the package is fully installed, let's update the new
      to-do creation prompt component to use the picker.
      
      Add the following imports to the top of ``src/CreateToDoPrompt.tsx``:

      .. code-block:: javascript
         :caption: CreateToDoPrompt.tsx
         
         import {Picker} from '@react-native-picker/picker';
         import {Priority} from './ItemSchema';
   
      Then, modify the ``CreateToDoPrompt`` component:
      
      - add ``priority`` to the ``onSubmit()`` props definition
      - keep track of ``priority`` in a state hook
      - connect the state to the ``Picker`` component that you imported
      - pass ``priority`` to the ``onSubmit()`` handler

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/react-native/CreateToDoPrompt.snippet.create-todo-prompt.tsx
        :language: javascript
        :caption: src/CreateToDoPrompt.tsx
        :emphasize-lines: 2, 8, 20-31, 35

      In ``src/ItemListView.tsx``, modify the ``createItem()`` function
      to accept and use ``priority``:

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/react-native/ItemListView.snippet.create-item.tsx
        :language: javascript
        :caption: src/ItemListView.tsx
        :emphasize-lines: 1, 8

      Then, modify the new to-do submission handler to accept the
      ``priority`` level and pass it to ``createItem()``:

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/react-native/ItemListView.snippet.instantiate-create-todo-prompt.tsx
        :language: javascript
        :caption: src/ItemListView.tsx
        :emphasize-lines: 2, 4

      Finally, modify each to-do's list item to include its ``priority``
      before the ``summary``:

      .. TODO: replace with define-list-item - add emphasis

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/react-native/ItemListView.snippet.define-list-item.tsx
        :language: javascript
        :caption: src/ItemListView.tsx
        :emphasize-lines: 7

   .. step:: Run and Test the App

      Your app should now allow users to set a priority level for each
      new to-do item.
      
      Rebuild the app and open it. Add some new to-do items to confirm
      that you can choose a priority level and that the list displays
      each to-do's priority.
      
Update the Sync Subscription
----------------------------

The Device Sync protocol uses a flexible model where each sync client
uses a standard RQL query to choose a subset of application data and
then *subscribes* to the subset. This automatically pulls the latest
version of all data in the subset to the device and syncs changes to the
data between devices.

For example, the template app you're using has the following
built-in subscription to items that the current user owns:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :caption: ItemListView.tsx
   
   await realm.subscriptions.update(mutableSubs => {
     // subscribe to all of the logged in user's to-do items
     let ownItems = realm
      .objects("Item")
      .filtered(`owner_id == "${user.id}"`);
     // use the same name as the initial subscription to update it
     mutableSubs.add(ownItems, {name: "ownItems"});
   });

You can customize the subscription on the fly to sync only the data that
your app needs. Let's add a feature to demonstrate how.
  
For this tutorial, we'll add a button that lets us toggle between two
"modes": one where the app syncs *all* to-do items and another where it
only syncs "important" ones with a ``priority`` of High or Severe.

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Add a Mode Toggle to the UI

      First, add a ``useState()`` hook to the ``ItemListView`` component
      to keep track of the current mode:

      .. code-block:: javascript
         :caption: ItemListView.tsx

         const [showImportantOnly, setShowImportantOnly] = useState(false);

      Then, add a new button that toggles the mode to the bottom of the
      to-do list:

      .. code-block:: javascript
         :caption: ItemListView.tsx
         :emphasize-lines: 6-13

         {items.map(item => (
           <ListItem key={`${item._id}`} bottomDivider topDivider>
             {/* ... */}
           </ListItem>
         ))}
         <Button
           title={showImportantOnly ? 'Show All' : 'Show Important Only'}
           buttonStyle={{
             ...styles.addToDoButton,
             backgroundColor: showImportantOnly ? '#00A35C' : '#FFC010',
           }}
           onPress={() => setShowImportantOnly(showImportantOnly => !showImportantOnly)}
         />

   .. step:: Update the Sync Subscription

      At this point, the app can switch modes in the UI, but we haven't
      done anything else so the modes are functionally identical. Let's
      update the sync subscription to only sync data relevant to the
      current mode.

      In the first ``useEffect`` of the ``ItemListView`` component,
      add code that checks the current mode and appends an additional
      ``priority`` filter to the query if "important only" mode is
      active:

      .. code-block:: javascript
         :caption: ItemListView.tsx
         :emphasize-lines: 9-12, 18

         useEffect(() => {
           // initialize the subscriptions
           const updateSubscriptions = async () => {
             await realm.subscriptions.update(mutableSubs => {
               // subscribe to all of the logged in user's to-do items
               let ownItems = realm
                 .objects("Item")
                 .filtered(`owner_id == "${user.id}"`);
               if(showImportantOnly) {
                 // 'Severe' or 'High' priority items
                 ownItems = ownItems.filtered(`priority <= 1`);
               }
               // use the same name as the initial subscription to update it
               mutableSubs.add(ownItems, {name: 'ownItems'});
             });
           };
           updateSubscriptions();
         }, [realm, user, showImportantOnly]);

      .. important::

         Don't forget to add ``showImportantOnly`` to the list of
         dependencies in the second argument of ``useEffect``.

   .. step:: Test the App

      Your app is now set up to modify its sync subscription based on
      the current mode. However, if you run the app and switch to
      "important only" mode, you'll see that the list doesn't change and
      a warning appears in the console:

      .. code-block:: text
         :copyable: false
         
         Possible Unhandled Promise Rejection (id: 0):
         Error: Client provided query with bad syntax:
         unsupported query for table "Item": key "priority" is not a queryable field

   .. step:: Update the Sync Configuration
      
      We're getting a warning because a sync client can only filter a
      subscription based on a given field if that field is specifically
      listed as a "queryable field" in the Device Sync configuration of
      your Atlas App.

      To get everything working, we need to add ``priority`` as a
      queryable field in the Atlas App's sync configuration.
      
      First, find the template app's ``backend`` directory and modify
      ``sync/config.json``:

      .. code-block:: json
         :emphasize-lines: 6

         {
             ...,
             "queryable_fields_names": [
                 "_id",
                 "owner_id",
                 "priority"
             ]
         }
      
      Then, run the following terminal command from within the
      ``backend`` directory to deploy the updated sync configuration:

      .. code-block:: bash

         npx mongodb-realm-cli push

   .. step:: Run the Completed App
      
      Once your updated sync configuration is deployed, your app is
      complete and fully functional. Congratulations!
      
      Rebuild and run the app to make sure everything works. You should
      be able to create, complete, and delete to-do items as well as switch
      to and from "important only" mode.
