Overview
--------

You can configure Atlas App Services to store :ref:`custom user data <custom-user-data>` 
for the App's user in MongoDB Atlas. You can also configure App Services to store
:ref:`user metadata <configure-user-metadata-on-the-backend>` from authentication 
providers. 

.. _custom-user-data:

Enable Custom User Data
-----------------------

You can store arbitrary data about your application users in a MongoDB
collection and configure Atlas App Services to automatically expose each user's data
in a field of their :ref:`user object <user-objects>`. For example, you
might store a user's preferred language, date of birth, or their local
timezone.

App Services automatically finds a user's custom data document and includes it
in their access token when they log in. You can access the data in the
``custom_data`` field of the user's object in :ref:`function context
<context-user>`, the :json-expansion:`%%user` expansion,
and their client application access token.

.. note::

   Because App Services stores the custom user data in the access token
   in the HTTP header, you should keep the custom user data payload
   small (say, less than 16KB). Other services might limit the HTTP
   header size, which means that large custom user data objects can
   cause integration issues.

App Services does not manage custom user documents so you are responsible for
creating and deleting them. The underlying data is a regular MongoDB
document, so you can use standard CRUD operations through the
:doc:`MongoDB Atlas service </mongodb>` to define and modify a user's
custom data. You can also use :doc:`authentication triggers
</triggers/authentication-triggers>` to dynamically update user
documents, such as storing the time of their most recent login in the
``lastLogin`` field.

.. include:: /includes/define-custom-user-data-example.rst

.. important:: Store One Document Per User

   Documents that contain user data must include the user's ID in a
   specific field. If multiple documents specify
   the same user's ID, App Services only exposes the data from the
   document that was inserted first.

.. include:: /includes/custom-data-may-be-stale.rst

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

App Services stores MongoDB documents that correspond to custom user data
in a linked MongoDB Atlas cluster. When you
configure custom user data for your application, you specify:

- the custom user data cluster

- the custom user data database

- the custom user data collection in which custom
  user data documents are stored

- the user ID field used to map custom user data documents
  to users (via user ID)

- an optional Atlas Function that runs before new user accounts are created

.. _user-creation-function:

User Creation Function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can define a Function that runs every time a new user successfully
registers but before their new user account is created. If the function
throws or otherwise errors, the user account creation fails. This lets
you ensure that users always have custom data associated with them once
created.

The function receives a :ref:`user metadata object <user-objects>` as
its only argument. You can use this create a new custom user data
document for the user.

.. code-block:: javascript

   exports = async function onUserCreation(user) {
     const customUserDataCollection = context.services
       .get("mongodb-atlas")
       .db("myapp")
       .collection("users");
     try {
       await customUserDataCollection.insertOne({
         // Save the user's account ID to your configured user_id_field
         user_account_id: user.id,
         // Store any other user data you want
         favorite_color: "blue",
       });
     } catch (e) {
       console.error(`Failed to create custom user data document for user:${user.id}`);
       throw e
     }
   }

.. tip::

   Once you've configured a user creation function, App Services
   prevents you from deleting the function. If you want to delete the
   function, first change your custom user data configuration to use a
   different user creation function.

.. note::

   You currently cannot define a user creation function in the Admin UI.
   Instead, use {+cli+} or the Admin API.

.. _custom-user-data-permissions:

Configure Permissions for Custom User Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Because custom user data belongs to a specific user, it could contain
personal or private information depending on the needs of your
application. If your application stores such information in custom user
data, you should restrict access to custom user data appropriately.
While the permissioning model of your custom user data depends on the
needs of your application, consider using one of the following permission
models to restrict read and write access to privileged users only: 

- Make your custom user data readable and writable by only the user
  whose ID matches the user ID field of each custom user data
  document. In this permissioning model, the user writes custom user
  data to a :ref:`MongoDB data source <data-sources>` either directly
  or through :ref:`Device Sync <sync>`.

- Make your custom user data readable and writable by only a
  system user  in a system function. Create
  a system function that handles edits to custom user data for a user
  using the ``user.id`` value provided by the :ref:`function context
  <context-user>`. In this permissioning model, the user writes custom
  user data using the :ref:`Functions API <functions>`.

.. tabs-realm-admin-interfaces::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: ui
      
      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Navigate to the Custom User Data Configuration Screen

            You can configure and enable custom user data in the App Services UI. To
            get to the configuration page, click :guilabel:`App Users` in the
            left navigation menu and then select the :guilabel:`Custom User Data`
            tab.


         .. step:: Enable Custom User Data

            To configure App Services to associate data in a collection with your
            application's users, set the :guilabel:`Enable Custom User Data`
            toggle to :guilabel:`On`.

            .. figure:: /images/enable-custom-user-data-toggle-realm-ui.png
               :alt: The toggle button to enable custom user data in the App Services UI, set to On.
               :width: 750px
               :lightbox:


         .. step:: Specify the Custom User Data Collection

            You must store the custom data for your application's users in a
            single collection of a linked MongoDB Atlas cluster. To configure your
            application to read user data from this collection, you need to
            specify the following values:

            - :guilabel:`Cluster Name`: The name of a :doc:`linked MongoDB cluster
              </mongodb>` that contains the custom user data collection.

            - :guilabel:`Database Name`: The name of the MongoDB database that
              contains the custom user data collection.

            - :guilabel:`Collection Name`: The name of the MongoDB collection that
              contains custom user data.

            .. figure:: /images/custom-user-data-config-realm-ui.png
               :alt: Input boxes for the collection and user id field in the App Services UI.
               :width: 750px
               :lightbox:


         .. step:: Specify the User ID Field

            Every document in the custom user data collection should have a field that
            maps it to a specific application user. The field must be present in every
            document that maps to a user and contain the user's ID as a string.

            Specify the name of the field that contains each user's ID in the
            :guilabel:`User ID Field` input.

            .. note::

               If two documents contain the same user ID, App Services only
               maps the first matching document to the user.


         .. step:: Deploy the Updated Application

            Once you have configured the custom user data collection, you can
            make custom user data available to client applications by deploying
            your application. To deploy a draft application from the App Services UI:

            1. Click :guilabel:`Deploy` in the left navigation menu.

            2. Find the draft in the deployment history table and then click
               :guilabel:`Review & Deploy Changes`.

            3. Review the diff of changes and then click :guilabel:`Deploy`.

            Once the application successfully deploys, App Services begins to associate
            custom data with users. When a user logs in, App Services automatically
            queries the custom user data collection for a document where the
            specified :guilabel:`User ID Field` contains the user's ID. If a
            document matches, App Services exposes the data in the document in the
            ``custom_data`` field of that user's :ref:`user object
            <user-objects>`.
   
   .. tab::
      :tabid: cli
      
      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Pull the Latest Version of Your App

            To define custom user data with {+cli-bin+}, you need a local copy of your
            application's configuration files.

            To pull a local copy of the latest version of your app, run the following:

            .. code-block:: bash

               realm-cli pull --remote="<Your App ID>"

            .. tip::

               You can also download a copy of your application's configuration files from
               the :guilabel:`Deploy > Export App` screen in the App Services UI.


         .. step:: Configure Custom User Data

            You must store the custom data for your application's users in a single
            collection of a :ref:`linked Atlas cluster <link-a-data-source>`. Every
            document in the collection should include a specific field that contains the
            user ID of the App Services user that it describes.

            To configure your application to read user data from this collection, define a
            :ref:`custom user data configuration document <config-custom-user-data>` in
            the ``/auth/custom_user_data.json``:

            .. code-block:: javascript
               :caption: /auth/custom_user_data.json

               {
                 "enabled": <Boolean>,
                 "mongo_service_name": "<MongoDB Data Source Name>",
                 "database_name": "<Database Name>",
                 "collection_name": "<Collection Name>",
                 "user_id_field": "<Field Name>",
                 "on_user_creation_function_name": "<Function Name>"
               }


         .. step:: Deploy the Custom User Data Configuration

            Once you've configured custom user data, you can push the updated config to
            your remote app. {+cli+} immediately deploys the update on push.

            .. code-block:: bash

               realm-cli push --remote="<Your App ID>"

.. _configure-user-metadata-on-the-backend:

Enable User Metadata 
--------------------

Atlas App Services can read user metadata from authentication providers. Then, 
App Services exposes each user's data in a field of their :ref:`user 
object <user-objects>`. For example, you might want to access a user's name, 
email, birthday, or gender.

You can configure App Services to request metadata with the access token 
when users log in. You can access that data from the logged-in user's 
object with a client SDK.

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can define the metadata to request when you configure authentication 
providers. Specify optional metadata fields that you want to access through 
the user's account. These metadata fields vary depending on provider.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 75

   * - Provider
     - Metadata fields

   * - Facebook
     - - ``name``
       - ``first_name``
       - ``last_name``
       - ``picture``
       - ``gender``
       - ``birthday``
       - ``min_age``
       - ``max_age``
       - ``email``
   
   * - Google
     - - ``name``
       - ``first_name``
       - ``last_name``
       - ``picture``
       - ``email``

   * - Custom JWT
     - Custom. You specify :ref:`JWT authentication metadata
       <custom-jwt-authentication-configuration-metadata-fields>` to request when 
       you configure it.

               the App Dashboard.


         .. step:: Configure User Metadata

            You can find authentication provider :ref:`metadata_fields
            <config-auth-providers>` for your app in ``/auth/providers.json``.
            Update this array to request user metadata from the authentication provider.

            **Google or Facebook**

            This array resembles:

            .. code-block:: javascript
