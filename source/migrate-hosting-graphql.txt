As of March 12, 2024, GraphQL and Static Hosting are deprecated for Atlas App
Services. GraphQL and Static Hosting services will be discontinued after one
year on March 12, 2025.

If you use GraphQL or Static Hosting, you should migrate to other providers
before the services are discontinued. Below, you can find migration guides
for official, trusted MongoDB partners that offer best-in-class alternative
solutions. These migration guides offer step by step guidance for how to
transition off of our services, and have been created in collaboration with our
partners.

GraphQL Providers

The following GraphQL providers can help you keep your projects running.

Apollo
~~~~~~

Apollo provides a developer platform and open-source tools and SDKs—including
Apollo Server—to unify your data and services. Apollo Server is a
spec-compliant, production-ready server library that can use data from any
source, including MongoDB Atlas.

websites with modern, composable tooling that works with all modern frontend
frameworks. With support for static site generation (SSG), server-side rendering
(SSR) and incremental site regeneration (ISR), Netlify's managed frontend cloud
and CI/CD can support the growing needs of your App Services application.
