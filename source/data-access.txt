You can query data in MongoDB Atlas from client applications using standar
 MongoDB query language syntax with **MongoDB Data Access** in the Realm SDKs.

The MongoDB Data Access secures data with role-based App Services rules, schemas,
and filters.

When to Use MongoDB Data Access
-------------------------------

Some general scenarios when you might want to use MongoDB Data Access in an application:

- You want to use an API like the MongoDB drivers
- When you want to perform aggregations
- You want to dynamically construct queries from the client device.

You might want to use MongoDB Data Access **instead of** Atlas Device Sync
in an application in these scenarios:

- You are querying documents that are not or cannot be modeled in Realm Database.
- A non-Realm service generates collections that you want to access.
- You are using the Realm Web SDK, which does not support Realm Database or Device Sync.
- You do not want to persist data locally.

.. note:: Limited Server-Side Use

You should not use the Realm SDKs' Data Access to support significant
server-side workloads. In server-side environments, use a MongoDB Driver.
