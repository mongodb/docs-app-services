Use a VPC Private Endpoint

You can use a Private Endpoint to access Atlas App Services from within
your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). This is a private connection to Atlas
App Services that does not go over the public internet.

Private Endpoints are only available for Atlas App Services Apps
deployed locally to a region in AWS. They connect to your AWS VPC using
AWS PrivateLink. To learn more, see `What is AWS PrivateLink?
<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/what-is-privatelink.html>`__
in the AWS documentation.

Private Endpoint Limitations
----------------------------

- You cannot use Private Endpoints with globally deployed Apps or local
  Apps deployed to Azure or GCP.

- If you :ref:`change your deployment model <change-deployment-models>`
  then your existing Private Endpoints will not continue to work. You
  will have to create new Private Endpoints for the App's new region.

- You cannot simultaneously use Private Endpoints and :ref:`allow
  connections over the MongoDB wire protocol <wire-protocol>`. If one is
  enabled, you cannot enable the other.

Set Up a Private Endpoint
-------------------------

To configure a Private Endpoint connection you need to have the
following information:

- Your **VPC ID**, which you can find in the AWS VPC dashboard or
  by running the :aws:`describe-vpcs
  </cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-vpcs>` command in the AWS
  CLI.

- Your **Subnet IDs**, which you can find in the AWS VPC dashboard
  or by running the :aws:`describe-subnets
  </cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-subnets>` command in the AWS
  CLI.

- The App Services **Endpoint Service Name** for your region. If
  you're using the App Services UI, this value will be provided to
  you. If you're using the Admin API, you can find this value by
  calling the :admin-api-endpoint:`List VPC Private Endpoint Services
  <operation/adminListPrivateEndpointServiceInfo>` endpoint and
  then locating the entry for your App's deployment region in the
  response.

  .. io-code-block::

      .. input::
        :language: sh

        curl https://realm.mongodb.com/api/admin/v3.0/groups/{groupId}/apps/{appId}/security/private_endpoint_service_infos \
          -H "Authorization: Bearer <access_token>"

      .. output::
        :language: json
        :emphasize-lines: 6

        [
          {
            "cloud_provider_region": "aws-us-east-1",
            "name": "eps_baas-pl-prod_us-east-1_cloud",
            "dns": "*.aws.realm.mongodb.com",
            "service_name": "com.amazonaws.vpce.us-east-1.vpce-svc-0f12ab34cd56ef789"
          },
          ...
        ]

Once you have this information, you can set up the Private Endpoint
connection using either the App Services UI or the Admin API.

         .. step:: Create an Interface Endpoint in Your VPC

            To use a Private Endpoint, you must first create a VPC
            interface endpoint in AWS. You can do this using the
            :aws:`create-vpc-endpoint
            </cli/latest/reference/ec2/create-vpc-endpoint>` command in the
            AWS CLI. The UI will walk you through creating this command.

            a. In the left navigation, click :guilabel:`App Settings`.

            #. Click the :guilabel:`Private Endpoints` tab.

            #. Click the :guilabel:`Add Private Endpoint` button.

            #. Enter your **VPC ID** in the input box.

            #. Enter your **Subnet IDs** as a comma-separated list in the input box.

            #. Optionally, enter a comment that describes the purpose of the
               endpoint.

            Once you've entered this information, the fully constructed
            AWS CLI command is displayed in the UI. Copy the command and
            run it in your terminal. It should resemble the following:

            .. code-block:: sh

               aws ec2 create-vpc-endpoint \
                 --vpc-endpoint-type Interface
                 --service-name <App Services Endpoint Service Name> \
                 --vpc-id <your-vpc-id> \
                 --region <your-aws-deployment-region> \
                 --subnet-ids <your-subnet-ids>

            After you run the command, click :guilabel:`Next`.

         .. step:: Add the Private Endpoint to Your App

            Now that you've created the interface endpoint in your VPC, you
            need to add it to your App. Find the **VPC Endpoint ID**, either
            in the output of the CLI command you ran in the previous step or
            on the endpoint details screen of the AWS VPC dashboard. This
            value starts with ``vpce-``.

            Once you have the **VPC Endpoint ID**, enter it in the input box.
            Then, click :guilabel:`Next`.

         .. step:: Modify Your VPC Private DNS

            Use the AWS CLI to modify your VPC private DNS settings. This
            ensures that your App can resolve the private endpoint's DNS name
            to the correct IP address.

            .. code-block:: sh

               aws ec2 modify-vpc-endpoint \
                 --region <your-aws-deployment-region> \
                 --vpc-endpoint-id <your-vpc-endpoint-id> \
                 --private-dns-enabled

   .. tab::
      :tabid: api

      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Create an Interface Endpoint in Your VPC

            To use a Private Endpoint, you must first create a VPC
            interface endpoint in AWS. You can do this using the
            :aws:`create-vpc-endpoint
            </cli/latest/reference/ec2/create-vpc-endpoint>` command in the
            AWS CLI.

            Modify the following command template with your private
            endpoint information. Then, copy the command and run it in
            your terminal:

            .. code-block:: sh

               aws ec2 create-vpc-endpoint \
                 --vpc-endpoint-type Interface
                 --service-name <App Services Endpoint Service Name> \
                 --vpc-id <your-vpc-id> \
                 --region <your-aws-deployment-region> \
                 --subnet-ids <your-subnet-ids>

         .. step:: Add the Private Endpoint to Your App

            Now that you've created the interface endpoint in your VPC, you
            need to add it to your App. Find the **VPC Endpoint ID**, either
            in the output of the CLI command you ran in the previous step or
            on the endpoint details screen of the AWS VPC dashboard. This
            value starts with ``vpce-``.

            Once you have the **VPC Endpoint ID**, call
            :admin-api-endpoint:`Create a VPC Private Endpoint
            <operation/adminCreatePrivateEndpoint>` with the Endpoint
            ID and cloud deployment region (e.g. ``aws-us-east-1``):

            .. code-block:: sh

               curl https://realm.mongodb.com/api/admin/v3.0/groups/{groupId}/apps/{appId}/security/private_endpoints \
                 -X POST \
                 -H "Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>" \
                 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
                 -d '{
                   "cloud_provider_region": "<your-cloud-deployment-region>",
                   "cloud_provider_endpoint_id": "<your-vpc-endpoint-id>"
                 }'

         .. step:: Modify Your VPC Private DNS

            Use the AWS CLI to modify your VPC private DNS settings. This
            ensures that your App can resolve the private endpoint's DNS name
            to the correct IP address.

            .. code-block:: sh

               aws ec2 modify-vpc-endpoint \
                 --region <your-aws-deployment-region> \
                 --vpc-endpoint-id <your-vpc-endpoint-id> \
                 --private-dns-enabled
