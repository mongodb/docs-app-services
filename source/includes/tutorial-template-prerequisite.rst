- This tutorial starts with a Template App. You need an `Atlas Account 
  <https://cloud.mongodb.com/user/register?tck=docs_realm>`_, an API key, and 
  {+cli-bin+} to create a Template App.

  - You can learn more about creating an Atlas account in the 
    :atlas:`Atlas Getting Started </getting-started>` documentation. For this 
    tutorial, you need an Atlas account with a free-tier cluster.

  - You also need an Atlas :atlas:`API key </configure-api-access/#programmatic-api-keys>`
    for the MongoDB Cloud account you wish to log in with. 
    You must be a :atlas:`Project Owner </reference/user-roles/#project-roles>` 
    to create a Template App using {+cli-bin+}.

  - To learn more about installing {+cli-bin+}, see
    :ref:`Install app-services-cli <install-app-services-cli>`. After you have installed {+cli-bin+},
    :ref:`login <app-services-cli-login>` using the API key for your Atlas project.
