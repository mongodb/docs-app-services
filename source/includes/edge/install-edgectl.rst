Edge Server uses a command-line tool called ``edgectl`` to manage
the Edge Server instance on the host hardware. This includes an install
script to manage the installation and install required dependencies.

Use this command to install the command-line tool and the Edge Server 
code on the device where you want to run the Edge Server instance:

.. code-block:: shell

   curl -s https://services.cloud.mongodb.com/edge/install.sh | bash

Follow the prompts to download and install the Edge Server code.
