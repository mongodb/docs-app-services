The Edge Server dashboard lists a brief summary for each Edge Server
instance, including the date and time of the last connection, and a 
snapshot of its status. You can optionally view details or logs for each 
instance.

To view the Edge Server dashboard, choose :guilabel:`Edge Server` in
the left navigation sidebar.

To view the details for a specific Edge Server instance, click 
:guilabel:`View Details` for that Edge Server instance. Alternately,
click the :guilabel:`App Logs` button to browse logs associated with 
the instance.
