.. note:: Collections in Mixed fields supported in Apps created after March XX, 2024
    
    App Services Apps created *after* March XX, 2024 can store collections
    (arrays and dictionaries) in mixed data properties. You can 
    nest collections within other collections, which lets you store complex data
    structures such as JSON or MongoDB documents without having to define a 
    strict data model.

    To use feature with Atlas Device SDK, you must use :ref:`Flutter SDK v2.0.0 or later <flutter-realm-value>`. Support for other SDKs will be added in future releases.

    If your App was created before March XX, 2024, you can contact support to
    learn more about enabling this feature.
