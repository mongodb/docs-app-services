.. note:: Collections in Mixed fields supported in Apps created after March XX, 2024
    
    App Services Apps created *after* March XX, 2024 can store collections
    (arrays and dictionaries) in mixed data properties. This lets you 
    nest collections within other collections, and store complex data
    structures in a single property.

    To use feature with Atlas Device SDK, you must use :ref:`Flutter SDK v2.0.0 or later <flutter-realm-value>`. Support for other SDKs will be added in future releases.

    If your App was created before March XX, 2024, you can contact support to
    learn more about enabling this feature.
