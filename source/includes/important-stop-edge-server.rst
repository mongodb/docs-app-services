.. important:: Stop the Edge Server When Not In Use

   After you start the Edge Server instance, it attempts to maintain a 
   websocket connection to Atlas to remain in sync, even if no client 
   application is connected. If you are running a demo or otherwise working on 
   a PoC, remember to stop the Edge Server instance using ``edgectl stop`` 
   when you're done using it. Otherwise, you'll continue using the host's 
   compute and Device Sync time.
