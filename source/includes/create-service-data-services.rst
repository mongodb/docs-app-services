   .. step:: Navigate to the Data Services UI

      When you select a project in the Atlas UI Project dashboard, the
      :guilabel:`Data Services` tab displays by default.

      If you are in :guilabel:`App Services` or :guilabel:`Charts`,
      select the :guilabel:`Data Services` tab.

   .. step:: Choose a Service

      In the left sidebar, browse to the :guilabel:`Services` section. You can
      create or view several types of services here, from Edge & Device Sync to
      Triggers or Atlas Search.

      If you have previously enabled a service in the project, selecting the 
      service from the sidebar gives you details about that service.

      If you have not yet enabled the service in this project, follow the 
      on-screen prompts to configure the service.

   .. step:: Configure the Service

      If this is your first time setting up this type of service in this project,
      follow the on-screen prompts to configure the service.

      For details about configuring the service, refer to the relevant
      documentation:
