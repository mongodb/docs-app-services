.. important:: Stop the Tiered Sync Server When Not In Use

   After you start the Tiered Sync server, it connects to the App Services App
   every few minutes to check for updates, even when no client application is
   connected. If you are running a demo or otherwise working on a PoC, remember
   to stop the Tiered Sync server using ``make stop`` when you're done using it. 
   Otherwise, you'll continue using the host's compute and Device Sync time.
