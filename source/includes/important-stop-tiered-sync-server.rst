.. important:: Stop the Edge Server When Not In Use

   After you start the Edge Server, it attempts to maintain a websocket 
   connection to Atlas App Services to remain in sync, even if no client 
   application is connected. If you are running a demo or otherwise working 
   on a PoC, remember to stop the Edge Server using ``make down`` when 
   you're done using it. Otherwise, you'll continue using the host's 
   compute and Device Sync time.
