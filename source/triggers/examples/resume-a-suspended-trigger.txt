Resume a Suspended Trigger
==========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Triggers may enter a :ref:`suspended <suspended_triggers>` state in
response to an event that prevents the Trigger's change stream from
continuing, such as a network disruption or change to the underlying
cluster. When a Trigger enters a suspended state, it does not receive
change events and will not fire.

.. note:: 

   In the event of a suspended or failed trigger, Atlas App Services sends the 
   project owner an email alerting them of the issue. 

You can attempt to restart a suspended Trigger from the {+ui+} or by
importing an application directory with {+cli-bin+}.

         .. step:: Find the Suspended Trigger

            On the :guilabel:`Database Triggers` tab of the :guilabel:`Triggers`
            page, find the trigger that you want to resume in the list of
            triggers. App Services marks suspended triggers with a :guilabel:`Status` of
            :guilabel:`Suspended`.

         .. step:: Restart the Trigger

            Click :guilabel:`Restart` in the trigger's :guilabel:`Actions` column.
            You can choose to restart the trigger with a change stream
            :manual:`resume token </changeStreams/#resume-a-change-stream>` or
            open a new change stream. Indicate whether or not to use a resume
            token and then click :guilabel:`Resume Database Trigger`.

            .. note:: Resume Tokens

               If you use a :manual:`resume token
               </changeStreams/#resume-a-change-stream>`, App Services
               attempts to resume the trigger's underlying change
               stream at the event immediately following the last
               change event it processed. If successful, the trigger
               processes any events that occurred while it was
               suspended. If you do not use a resume token, the
               trigger begins listening for new events but will not
               fire for any events that occurred while it was
               suspended.

         .. step:: Pull Your App's Latest Configuration Files

            .. code-block:: shell

               realm-cli pull --remote=<App ID>


         .. step:: Verify that the Trigger Configuration File Exists

            If you exported a new copy of your application, it should already include an
            up-to-date configuration file for the suspended trigger. You can confirm that
            the configuration file exists by looking in the ``/triggers`` directory for a
            :ref:`trigger configuration file <config-database-trigger>` with the same name
            as the trigger.


         .. step:: Redeploy the Trigger

            After you have verified that the trigger configuration file exists, push the
            configuration back to your app. App Services automatically attempts to resume
            any suspended triggers included in the deployment.
