Disable a Trigger
=================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Triggers may enter a :guilabel:`suspended` state in response to
an event that prevents the Trigger's change stream from continuing, such
as a network disruption or change to the underlying cluster. When a
Trigger enters a suspended state, it does not receive change events and will not
fire.

.. note:: 

   In the event of a suspended or failed trigger, {+service-short+} sends the 
   project owner an email alerting them of the issue. 

You can suspend a Trigger from the {+ui+} or by
importing an application directory with {+cli-bin+}.

         .. step:: Find the Trigger

            On the :guilabel:`Database Triggers` tab of the :guilabel:`Triggers`
            page, find the trigger that you want to disable in the list of
            Triggers.

         .. step:: Disable the Trigger

            Switch the :guilabel:`Enabled` toggle to the "off" setting.

            :guilabel:`review draft & deploy` button to release your changes.

            .. code-block:: shell

               realm-cli pull --remote=<App ID>


         .. step:: Verify that the Trigger Configuration File Exists

            If you exported a new copy of your application, it should already include an
            up-to-date configuration file for the suspended trigger. You can confirm that
            the configuration file exists by looking in the ``/triggers`` directory for a
            :ref:`trigger configuration file <config-database-trigger>` with the same name
            as the trigger.


         .. step:: Disable the Trigger

            After you have verified that the trigger configuration file exists, add
            a field named ``"disabled"`` with the value ``true`` to the top level
            of the trigger json definition:

            .. code-block:: json
               :emphasize-lines: 9

               {
                  "id": "6142146e2f052a39d38e1605",
                  "name": "steve",
                  "type": "SCHEDULED",
                  "config": {
                     "schedule": "*/1 * * * *"
                  },
                  "function_name": "myFunc",
                  "disabled": true
               }


         .. step:: Deploy Your Changes

            Finally, push the configuration back to your app:

            .. code-block:: shell

               realm-cli push
