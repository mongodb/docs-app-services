Database Triggers allow you to execute server-side logic whenever a
document is added, updated, or removed in a linked MongoDB Atlas cluster.
Unlike SQL data triggers, which run on the database server, triggers run
on a serverless compute layer that scales independently of the database
server. Triggers automatically call :ref:`Atlas Functions <functions>`
and can forward events to external handlers through AWS EventBridge.

Use database triggers to implement event-driven data interactions. For
example, you can automatically update information in one document when a
related document changes or send a request to an external service
whenever a new document is inserted.

Database triggers use MongoDB :manual:`change streams </changeStreams>`
to watch for real-time changes in a collection. A change stream is a
series of :ref:`database events <database-events>` that each
describe an operation on a document in the collection. Your app opens a
single change stream for each collection with at least one enabled
trigger. If multiple triggers are enabled for a collection they all
share the same change stream.

You control which operations cause a trigger to fire as well as what
happens when it does. For example, you can run a function whenever a
specific field of a document is updated. The function can access the
entire change event, so you always know what changed. You can also pass
the change event to :ref:`AWS EventBridge <aws-eventbridge>` to handle
the event outside of Atlas.

Triggers support :manual:`$match
</reference/operator/aggregation/match>` expressions to filter change
events and :manual:`$project </reference/operator/aggregation/project>`
expressions to limit the data included in each event.

.. important:: Change Stream Limitations
   
   There are limits on the total number of change streams you can open
   on a cluster, depending on the cluster's size. Refer to :ref:`change
   stream limitations <mongodb-service-limitations-change-streams>` for
   more information.

   You cannot define a database trigger on a :ref:`serverless instance
   <serverless-caveats>` or :ref:`{+adf-instance+}
   <data-federation-caveats>` because they do not support change streams.

Create a Database Trigger
-------------------------

.. tabs-realm-admin-interfaces::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: ui
      
      To open the database trigger configuration screen in the App Services UI, click
      :guilabel:`Triggers` in the left navigation menu, select the
      :guilabel:`Database Triggers` tab, and then click :guilabel:`Add a
      Trigger`.
         
      Configure the trigger and then click :guilabel:`Save` at the bottom of
      the page to add it to your current deployment draft.

         :alt: Example UI that configures the trigger
   
   .. tab::
      :tabid: cli
      
      To create a database trigger with :doc:`realm-cli
      </cli>`:
      
      1. Add a database trigger :ref:`configuration file
         <config-database-trigger>` to the ``triggers`` subdirectory of a
         local application directory.
      
      2. :ref:`Deploy <deploy-cli>` the trigger:
      
         .. code-block:: shell
      
            realm-cli push
      
      .. note::
      
         Atlas App Services does not enforce specific filenames for Trigger
         configuration files. However, once imported, Atlas App Services will rename
         each configuration file to match the name of the Trigger it defines,
         e.g. ``mytrigger.json``.

.. _database-triggers-configuration:

Configuration
-------------

Database Triggers have the following configuration options:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 15 30

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - :guilabel:`Trigger Type`

     - The type of the Trigger. Set this value to :guilabel:`Database` for 
       database Triggers

   * - :guilabel:`Name`

     - The name of the Trigger.
      
   * - | :guilabel:`Enabled`

     - Enabled by default. Used to enable or disable the trigger. 
  
   * - :guilabel:`Skip Events On Re-Enable`
     
     - Disabled by default. If enabled, any change events that occurred while this 
       trigger was disabled will not be processed.

   * - :guilabel:`Event Ordering`
     
     - If enabled, trigger events are processed in the order in which they occur. 
       If disabled, events can be processed in parallel, which is faster when 
       many events occur at the same time.

       .. include:: /includes/trigger-event-ordering.rst

Within the :guilabel:`Trigger Source Details` section, the following configuration 
options are available:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 15 30

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - :guilabel:`Cluster Name`

     - The name of the MongoDB Service that the Trigger is
       associated with.

   * - :guilabel:`Database Name`

     - The MongoDB database that contains the watched
       collection.

   * - :guilabel:`Collection Name`

     - The name of the collection that the Trigger watches for
       change events.

   * - :guilabel:`Operation Type`

     - Checkboxes of :ref:`database operation types <database-event-operation-types>` 
       that cause the Trigger to fire. Select the operation types you want the 
       trigger to respond to.

       .. warning::

          Update operations executed from MongoDB Compass or the MongoDB Atlas
          Data Explorer fully replace the previous document. As a result,
          update operations from these clients will generate **Replace**
          change events rather than **Update** events.

   * - :guilabel:`Full Document`

     - If enabled, **Update** change events include the latest
       :manual:`majority-committed </reference/read-concern-majority/>`
       version of the modified document *after* the change was applied in
       the ``fullDocument`` field.

       .. note::

          Regardless of this setting:
          
          - **Insert** and **Replace** events always include the
            ``fullDocument`` field.
          
          - **Delete** events never include the ``fullDocument`` field.

   * - :guilabel:`Document Preimage`

     - If enabled, change events include a copy of the modified document
       from immediately *before* the change was applied in the
       ``fullDocumentBeforeChange`` field. All change events except for
       **Insert** events include the document preimage. Document preimages are 
       only supported on Atlas clusters running MongoDB 4.4+ on a non-sharded 
       cluster.

       .. tip:: Performance Optimization

          Preimages require additional storage overhead that may affect
          performance. If you're not using preimages on a collection,
          you should disable preimages. To learn more, see :ref:`Disable
          Collection-Level Preimages
          <database-triggers-disable-collection-level-preimages>`.

Within the :guilabel:`Function` section, you choose what action is taken when 
the trigger fires. You can choose to run a :ref:`function <functions>` or use 
:ref:`AWS EventBridge <aws-eventbridge>`. 

Within the :guilabel:`Advanced` section, the following **optional** configuration 
options are available:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 15 30

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - :guilabel:`Match Expression`

     - .. include:: /includes/trigger-match-expression.rst

   * - :guilabel:`Project Expression`

     - .. include:: /includes/trigger-project-expression.rst

   * - :guilabel:`Auto-Resume Triggers`

     - .. include:: /includes/trigger-auto-resume.rst

.. _database-events:

Database Change Events
----------------------

.. _database-event-operation-types:

Database change events represent individual changes in a specific
collection of your linked MongoDB Atlas cluster.

Every database event has the same operation type and structure as the
:manual:`change event </reference/change-events/>` object that was
emitted by the underlying change stream. Change events have the
following operation types:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 30

   * - Operation Type
     - Description

   * - **Insert**
     - Represents a new document added to the collection.

   * - **Update**
     - Represents a change to an existing document in the collection.

   * - **Delete**
     - Represents a document deleted from the collection.

   * - **Replace**
     - Represents a new document that replaced a document in the collection.


Database change event objects have the following general form:

.. code-block:: json

   {
      _id : <ObjectId>,
      "operationType": <string>,
      "fullDocument": <document>,
      "fullDocumentBeforeChange": <document>,
      "ns": {
         "db" : <string>,
         "coll" : <string>
      },
      "documentKey": {
        "_id": <ObjectId>
      },
      "updateDescription": <document>,
      "clusterTime": <Timestamp>
   }

Database Trigger Example
------------------------

An online store wants to notify its customers whenever one of their
orders changes location. They record each order in the ``store.orders``
collection as a document that resembles the following:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     _id: ObjectId("59cf1860a95168b8f685e378"),
     customerId: ObjectId("59cf17e1a95168b8f685e377"),
     orderDate: ISODate("2018-06-26T16:20:42.313Z"),
     shipDate: ISODate("2018-06-27T08:20:23.311Z"),
     orderContents: [
       { qty: 1, name: "Earl Grey Tea Bags - 100ct", price: NumberDecimal("10.99") }
     ],
     shippingLocation: [
       { location: "Memphis", time: ISODate("2018-06-27T18:22:33.243Z") },
     ]
   }

To automate this process, the store creates a Database Trigger that
listens for **Update** change events in the ``store.orders`` collection.
When the trigger observes an **Update** event, it passes the
:ref:`change event object <database-events>` to its associated Function,
``textShippingUpdate``. The Function checks the change event for any
changes to the ``shippingLocation`` field and, if it was updated, sends
a text message to the customer with the new location of the order.

.. _suspended_triggers:
.. _resume-a-suspended-trigger:

Suspended Triggers
------------------

Database Triggers may enter a suspended state in response to an event
that prevents the Trigger's change stream from continuing. Events that
can suspend a Trigger include:

- :manual:`invalidate events </reference/change-events/#invalidate-event>`
  such as ``dropDatabase``, ``renameCollection``, or those caused by
  a network disruption.

- the **resume token** required to resume the change stream is no longer in the
  cluster :manual:`oplog </core/replica-set-oplog/>`. The App logs
  refer to this as a ``ChangeStreamHistoryLost`` error.

In the event of a suspended or failed trigger, Atlas App Services sends the
project owner an email alerting them of the issue.

.. _automatically-resume-a-suspended-trigger:

Automatically Resume a Suspended Trigger
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can configure a Trigger to automatically resume if the Trigger was suspended
because the resume token is no longer in the oplog.
The Trigger does not process any missed change stream events between
when the resume token is lost and when the resume process completes.

.. tabs-realm-admin-interfaces::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: ui

      When :ref:`creating or updating a Database Trigger <create-a-database-trigger>`
      in the App Services UI, navigate to the configuration page of the Trigger
      you want to automatically resume if suspended.

      In the :guilabel:`Advanced (Optional)` section, select :guilabel:`Auto-Resume Triggers`.

      Save and deploy the changes.

   .. tab::
      :tabid: cli

      When :ref:`creating or updating a Database Trigger <create-a-database-trigger>`
      with the Realm CLI, create or navigate to the configuration file for the Trigger
      you want to automatically resume if suspended.

      In the :ref:`Trigger's configuration file <appconfig-triggers>`,
      include the following:

      .. code-block:: js
        :caption: triggers/<trigger name>.json
        :emphasize-lines: 5

        {
          "name": "<Trigger Name>",

          "config": {
            "tolerate_resume_errors": true,
            // ...rest of Database Trigger configuration
          },
          // ...rest of Trigger general configuration
        }

      Deploy the changes with the following command:

      .. code-block:: shell

          realm-cli push --remote=<App ID>

.. _manually-resume-a-suspended-trigger:

Manually Resume a Suspended Trigger
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you manually resume a suspended Trigger, your App attempts to resume the Trigger
at the next change stream event after the change stream stopped.
If the resume token is no longer in the cluster oplog, the Trigger
must be started without a resume token. This means the Trigger begins
listening to new events but does not process any missed past events.

You can adjust the oplog size to keep the resume token for more time after
a suspension by :atlas:`scaling your Atlas cluster </scale-cluster/>`.
Maintain an oplog size a few times greater than
your cluster's peak oplog throughput (GB/hour) to reduce the risk of a
suspended trigger's resume token dropping off the oplog
before the trigger executes.
View your cluster's oplog throughput in the **Oplog GB/Hour** graph in the
:atlas:`Atlas cluster metrics </monitor-cluster-metrics/>`.

You can attempt to restart a suspended Trigger from the App Services UI or by
importing an application directory with {+cli-bin+}.

.. tabs-realm-admin-interfaces::

         .. step:: Find the Suspended Trigger

            On the :guilabel:`Database Triggers` tab of the :guilabel:`Triggers`
            page, find the trigger that you want to resume in the list of
            triggers. App Services marks suspended triggers
            with a :guilabel:`Status` of :guilabel:`Suspended`.

            .. figure:: /images/suspended-db-trigger.png
               :alt: A database trigger that is marked Suspended in the UI


         .. step:: Restart the Trigger

            Click :guilabel:`Restart` in the trigger's :guilabel:`Actions` column.
            You can choose to restart the trigger with a change stream
            :manual:`resume token </changeStreams/#resume-a-change-stream>` or
            open a new change stream. Indicate whether or not to use a resume
            token and then click :guilabel:`Resume Database Trigger`.

            .. note:: Resume Tokens

               If you use a :manual:`resume token
               </changeStreams/#resume-a-change-stream>`, App Services
               attempts to resume the trigger's underlying change
               stream at the event immediately following the last
               change event it processed. If successful, the trigger
               processes any events that occurred while it was
               suspended. If you do not use a resume token, the
               trigger begins listening for new events but will not
               fire for any events that occurred while it was
               suspended.

         .. step:: Verify that the Trigger Configuration File Exists

            If you exported a new copy of your application, it should already
            include an up-to-date configuration file for the suspended trigger.
            You can confirm that the configuration file exists by looking
            in the ``/triggers`` directory for a :ref:`trigger configuration file
            <config-database-trigger>` with the same name as the trigger.


         .. step:: Redeploy the Trigger

            After you have verified that the trigger configuration file exists,
            push the configuration back to your app. App Services
            automatically attempts to resume any suspended triggers included
            in the deployment.

            .. code-block:: shell

               realm-cli push

.. _last-cluster-time-processed:

Trigger Time Reporting
----------------------

The list of Triggers in the Atlas App Services UI shows three timestamps:

**Last Modified**

This is the time the Trigger was created or most recently changed.

**Latest Heartbeat**

Atlas App Services keeps track of the last time a trigger was run. If the trigger 
is not sending any events, the server sends a heartbeat to ensure the trigger's 
resume token stays fresh. Whichever event is most recent is shown as the 
:guilabel:`Latest Heartbeat`.

**Last Cluster Time Processed**

Atlas App Services also keeps track of the :guilabel:`Last Cluster Time Processed`, 
which is the last time the change stream backing a Trigger emitted an event. It 
will be older than the :guilabel:`Latest Heartbeat` if there have been no events 
since the most recent heartbeat.


Performance Optimization
------------------------

.. _database-triggers-disable-event-ordering:

Disable Event Ordering for Burst Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Consider disabling event ordering if your trigger fires on a collection that
receives short bursts of events (e.g. inserting data as part of a daily batch
job).

Ordered Triggers wait to execute a Function for a particular event until the
Functions of previous events have finished executing. As a consequence,
ordered Triggers are effectively rate-limited by the run time of each
sequential Trigger function. This may cause a significant delay between the
database event and the Trigger firing if a sufficiently large number of
Trigger executions are currently in the queue.

Unordered Triggers execute functions in parallel if possible, which can be
significantly faster (depending on your use case) but does not guarantee that
multiple executions of a Trigger Function occur in event order.

.. _database-triggers-disable-collection-level-preimages:

Disable Collection-Level Preimages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Document preimages require your cluster to record additional data about
each operation on a collection. Once you enable preimages for any
trigger on a collection, your cluster stores preimages for every
operation on the collection.

The additional storage space and compute overhead may degrade trigger
performance depending on your cluster configuration.

To avoid the storage and compute overhead of preimages, you must disable
preimages for the entire underlying MongoDB collection. This is a
separate setting from any individual trigger's preimage setting.

If you disable collection-level preimages, then no active trigger on
that collection can use preimages. However, if you delete or disable all
preimage triggers on a collection, then you can also disable
collection-level preimages.

To learn how, see :ref:`Disable Preimages for a Collection
<disable-collection-preimages>`.

.. _database-triggers-match-expression:

Use Match Expressions to Limit Trigger Invocations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can limit the number of Trigger invocations by specifying a :manual:`$match
</reference/operator/aggregation/match>` expression in the :guilabel:`Match
Expression` field. App Services evaluates the match expression against the
change event document and invokes the Trigger only if the expression evaluates
to true for the given change event.

The match expression is a JSON document that specifies the query conditions
using the :manual:`MongoDB read query syntax </reference/operator/query/>`.

We recommend only using match expressions when the volume of Trigger events
measurably becomes a performance issue. Until then, receive all events and
handle them individually in the Trigger function code.

The exact shape of the change event document depends on the event that caused
the trigger to fire. For details, see the reference for each event type:

- :manual:`insert </reference/change-events/insert>`
- :manual:`update </reference/change-events/update>`
- :manual:`replace </reference/change-events/replace>`
- :manual:`delete </reference/change-events/delete>`



.. example::
   
   The following match expression allows the Trigger to fire
   only if the change event object specifies that the ``status`` field in 
   a document changed.
   
   ``updateDescription`` is a field of the :manual:`update Event object </reference/change-events/update>`.
   
   .. code-block:: javascript
   
      {
        "updateDescription.updatedFields.status": {
          "$exists": true
        }
      }

   The following match expression allows the Trigger to fire only when a
   document's ``needsTriggerResponse`` field is ``true``. The ``fullDocument``
   field of the :manual:`insert </reference/change-events/insert>`,
   :manual:`update </reference/change-events/update>`, and :manual:`replace
   </reference/change-events/replace>` events represents a document after the
   given operation. To receive the ``fullDocument`` field, you must enable
   :guilabel:`Full Document` in your Trigger configuration.

   .. code-block:: javascript
     
      {
        "fullDocument.needsTriggerResponse": true
      }


Testing Match Expressions
`````````````````````````

The following procedure shows one way to test whether your match expression
works as expected:

1. Download `the MongoDB Shell (mongosh)
   <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-shell/>`__ and use it to
   :atlas:`connect to your cluster </mongo-shell-connection/>`.
#. Replacing ``DB_NAME`` with your database name, ``COLLECTION_NAME`` with your
   collection name, and ``YOUR_MATCH_EXPRESSION`` with the match expression you
   want to test, paste the following into mongosh to open a change stream on an
   existing collection:

   .. code-block:: js
 
      db.getSiblingDB(DB_NAME).COLLECTION_NAME.watch([{$match: YOUR_MATCH_EXPRESSION}])
      while (!watchCursor.isClosed()) {
        if (watchCursor.hasNext()) {
          print(tojson(watchCursor.next()));
        }
      }

#. In another terminal window, use mongosh to make changes to some test
   documents in the collection.
#. Observe what the change stream filters in and out.

.. _database-triggers-project-expression:

Use Project Expressions to Reduce Input Data Size
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the :guilabel:`Project Expression` field, 
limit the number of fields that the Trigger processes by using a 
:manual:`$project </reference/operator/aggregation/project>` expression. 

.. note:: Project is inclusive only

  When using Triggers, a projection expression is inclusive *only*. 
  Project does not support mixing inclusions and exclusions.
  The project expression must be inclusive because Triggers require you 
  to include ``operationType``. 
  
  If you want to exclude a single field, the projection expression must 
  include every field *except* the one you want to exclude.
  You can only explicitly exclude ``_id``, which is included by default.

.. example::
   
   A trigger is configured with the following :guilabel:`Project Expression`:
   
   .. code-block:: json
   
      {
        "_id": 0,
        "operationType": 1,
        "updateDescription.updatedFields.status": 1
      }
   
   The change event object that App Services passes to the trigger function
   only includes the fields specifed in the projection, as in the following
   example:
   
   .. code-block:: json
      
      {
        "operationType": "update",
        "updateDescription": {
          "updatedFields": {
            "status": "InProgress"
          }
        }
      }
