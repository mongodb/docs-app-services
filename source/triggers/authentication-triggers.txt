An authentication trigger fires when a user interacts with an 
:doc:`authentication provider </authentication/providers>`. You can 
use authentication triggers to implement advanced user management. Some uses include: 

- Storing new user data in your linked cluster
- Maintaining data integrity upon user deletion
- Calling a service with a user's information when they log in.

Example
-------

An online store wants to store custom metadata for each of its customers
in `{+atlas+} <https://www.mongodb.com/realm?
tck=docs_realm#atlas-form-container>`_.
Each customer needs a document in the ``store.customers`` collection. 
Then, the store can record and query metadata in the customer's document.

The collection must represent each customer. To guarantee this, the store 
creates an authentication trigger. This trigger listens for newly created users
in the :doc:`email/password </authentication/email-password>` authentication
provider. Then, it passes the
:ref:`authentication event object <authentication-events>` to its linked
function, ``createNewUserDocument``. The function creates a new document 
which describes the user and their activity. The function then inserts the document 
into the ``store.customers`` collection.

Configuration
-------------

Authentication Triggers have the following configuration options:
      
.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 15 30

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - :guilabel:`Trigger Type`

     - The type of the trigger. For authentication triggers,
       set this value to ``AUTHENTICATION``.

   * - :guilabel:`Trigger Name`

     - The name of the trigger.

   * - :guilabel:`Linked Function`

     - The name of the function that the trigger
       executes when it fires. An :ref:`authentication
       event object <authentication-events>` causes the trigger to fire. 
       This object is the only argument the trigger passes to the function.

   * - :guilabel:`Operation Type`

     - The :ref:`authentication operation
       type <authentication-event-operation-types>` that causes the trigger to
       fire.

   * - :guilabel:`Providers`

     - A list of one or more :doc:`authentication provider
       </authentication/providers>` types. The trigger only listens for
       :ref:`authentication events <authentication-events>` produced by these
       providers.

.. _authentication-events:

Authentication Events
---------------------

.. _authentication-event-operation-types:

Authentication events represent user interactions with an authentication
provider. Each event corresponds to a single user action with one of the
following operation types:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 30

   * - Operation Type
     - Description

   * - ``LOGIN``
     - Represents a single instance of a user logging in.

   * - ``CREATE``
     - Represents the creation of a new user.

   * - ``DELETE``
     - Represents the deletion of a user.

Authentication event objects have the following form:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   {
     "operationType": <string>,
     "providers": <array of strings>,
     "user": <user object>,
     "time": <ISODate>
   }

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 30

   * - Field
     - Description
   * - ``operationType``
     - The :ref:`operation type <authentication-event-operation-types>`
       of the authentication event.
   * - ``providers``
     - The :doc:`authentication providers </authentication/providers>`
       that emitted the event.

       One of the following names represents each authentication provider:

       .. include:: /includes/auth-provider-internal-names.rst

       .. note::

          Generally, only one authentication provider emits each event.
          However, you may need to delete a user linked to multiple providers.
          In this case, the ``DELETE`` event for that user includes all linked providers. 
   * - ``user``
     - The :doc:`user object </authentication>` of the user that interacted with
       the authentication provider.
   * - ``time``
     - The time at which the event occurred.
