Overview
--------

You secure your App's data by defining roles that are automatically
assigned to incoming user requests. Each role has fine-grained data
access permissions and dynamic conditions that determine when the role
applies.

What are Permissions?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A **permission** is a status that Atlas App Services assigns to individual users to control what
they can and cannot do in your app. App Services uses both document-level and
field-level permissions:

- Document-level permissions control whether a user can insert, delete, modify,
  and search for a specific document in a MongoDB collection. These permissions
  always apply to the entire document regardless of the content.

- Field-level permissions control whether a user can read or write the data in
  specific fields of a document. These permissions only affect the field they
  apply to, which means that a user may have read or write access to only a
  subset of the entire document.

What are Roles?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A **role** is a named set of permissions that a user may have for documents in a
MongoDB collection. Each role represents a possible relationship between a user
and an individual document. A user may play at most one role per document in
a request.

You define the roles a user can play for the documents in a collection. App Services
automatically assigns roles to the user at request time. Each role includes an
Apply When :ref:`expression <expressions>` that determines when App Services should
assign the role to a user as well as a set of document-level and field-level
permissions that apply to the role.

App Services only commits operations that a user is authorized to do based on their
assigned roles. If a role does not have permission to read a document or some of
its fields, App Services omits the document or fields from the results.

.. example::

   Consider a collection named ``employees`` where each employee has their own
   document with all of their employment data. This collection might have two
   roles: **Employee** and **Manager**.

   - If a user requests their own document, their role is **Employee**. An
     employee can read and write their own data but can't create or delete their
     own documents.

   - If a user requests a document for someone whose name is listed in the
     user's ``manages`` arrays, their role is **Manager**. A manager can read
     and write their direct reports' data and can create and delete their
     documents.

   - If a user is neither an **Employee** nor a **Manager** for a given
     document, then they have no role and cannot read, write, or search that
     document.

              ]
            }

Why Define a Role?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A role carries a specific set of permissions that you might expose to your app's
users. A user may play at most one role for each document, so each distinct set of
permissions that you need requires you to define a named role that encapsulates
those permissions.

The exact roles and permissions that you define will vary based on your app's
data and requirements. To determine good roles for a collection, consider your
data from the perspective of your app's users and what it might mean to them.

.. example::
   
   In addition to **Employee** and **Manager** roles, you might add a
   **Teammate** role to the ``employees`` collection to represent a user on the
   same team as the document's employee. Teammates can read each other's data
   but cannot modify it.
   
   .. code-block:: json
      
      {
        "name": "Teammate",
        "apply_when": { "team": "%%user.data.team" },
        "insert": false,
        "delete": false,
        "read": true,
        "write": false,
        "search": true,
        "fields": {},
        "additional_fields": {
          "read": true,
          "write": false
        }
      }

How App Services Assigns Roles
------------------------------

App Services dynamically assigns roles for every request. The user
is assigned a separate role, or no role, for each document that matches
the incoming query.

First, your App evaluates and applies :ref:`filters <filters>` and then
runs the query.

.. example::
   
   This request would cause App Services to evaluate a role for every document in the
   ``restaurants`` collection where the ``city`` field is set to ``"Chicago"``:
   
   .. code-block:: javascript
      
      db.restaurants.updateMany(
        { "city": "Chicago" },
        { "$set": { "city": "Chicago, IL" } }
      );

For each document returned by the query, your App evaluates possible
roles in :ref:`role order <role-order>` and assigns the first applicable
role, if any. A role applies to a given document if its Apply When
:ref:`expression <expressions>` evaluates to ``true`` when run against
the document.

The set of roles that a user may play for a given request depends on the
collection they're accessing. If the collection has a set of
collection-level roles defined, then a user may play any of those roles.
If there are no collection-level rules, the request falls back to the
data source's default roles.

.. example::
   
   An employee will always be on their own team, so both the **Employee** and
   **Teammate** roles apply to them for their own document. However, they can
   only one play one role, so we want to use **Employee** because it's more
   specific.
   
   To configure this, specify **Employee** earlier than **Teammate** in the
   collection's role definitions:
   
   .. tabs-realm-admin-interfaces:: 
      
      .. tab::
         :tabid: ui
         
         .. figure:: /images/role-order.png
            :alt: Role definitions that specify Manager first, Employee second, and Teammate third.
      
      .. tab::
         :tabid: cli
         
         .. code-block:: json
            
            {
              "database": "<Database Name>",
              "collection": "<Collection Name>",
              "roles": [
                { "name": "Manager", ... },
                { "name": "Employee", ... },
                { "name": "Teammate", ... }
              ]
            }

Define Roles & Permissions
--------------------------

You can configure your app's data access rules from the App Services UI or by
deploying configuration files with {+cli+}:

.. tabs-realm-admin-interfaces::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: ui

      1. Click :guilabel:`Rules` in the {+leftnav+} and then select a
         collection from the data source's collection list. You can also
         select :guilabel:`Default roles and filters` to configure
         :ref:`default rules <default-rules>` for the entire cluster.
      
         If no roles are defined yet, you'll be prompted to create a new
         one. Otherwise you'll see an ordered list of existing roles.
         
      2. To create a new role, click :guilabel:`Add role`. You can
         either start from scratch or use a preset role as a starting
         point.
         
      3. Give the role a name. The name can be anything you want but
         must be unique within a given collection. Consider using names
         that describe the user (e.g. ``Admin``) and/or their
         relationship to the data (e.g. ``Owner``).
      
      4. Define an :guilabel:`Apply When` expression that determines when
         a given user has the role for a given document.
      
      5. Define :ref:`document-level permissions <document-level-permissions>` for the role.
      
      6. Define :ref:`field-level permissions <field-level-permissions>` for the role.
      
      7. Save the role.

      8. If a collection has more than one role assigned, you can modify
         their :ref:`role order <role-order>` by clicking the arrows on
         each role.
     
   .. tab::
      :tabid: cli
      
      1. Pull the latest version of your app.
         
         .. code-block:: bash

            realm-cli pull --remote="<Your App ID>"
      
      2. Define :ref:`roles and filters <config-collection-rules>` for
         one or more collections. You can also define :ref:`default
         roles and filters <config-default-rules>` that apply to any
         unconfigured collection.

            realm-cli push

.. _apply-when-expressions:

Apply When Expressions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A role's :guilabel:`Apply When` expression is a :ref:`rule expression
<expressions>` that determines when a given user has the role for a
specific document. The expression is evaluated for each document that an
incoming query matches.

You can use expression variables to make roles dynamic. For example, you
can use :json-expansion:`%%user` to refer to the specific user that
issued the request or :json-expansion:`%%root` to reference the current
document. This lets you customize your data access permissions on a
per-user, per-document basis.

.. _document-level-permissions:

Document-Level Permissions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A role's document-level permissions determine which actions that affect
the entire document a user with the role can perform. A role can have
any of the following document-level permissions:

- **Insert**: The role can insert new documents.
- **Delete**: The role can delete existing documents.
- **Search**: The role can find the document in Atlas Search results.

.. _field-level-permissions:

Field-Level Permissions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A role's field-level permissions determine whether or not a user with
the role can read or write individual fields within the document.

You can define field-level permissions for specific fields as well as
default read/write permissions for any additional fields that you don't
explicity define.

.. _role-order:

Role Order
~~~~~~~~~~

The roles for a given collection each have a position that determines
the order in which they are evaluated and applied. Each role's apply
when expression is evaluated in role order until a role applies or no
roles remain.

A user may only have one role per document in a given query. Role order
determines which role applies in the event that multiple roles' apply
when expressions are true.
