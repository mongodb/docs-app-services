Overview
--------

The following steps guide you through setting up a generic App. The
term "App" refers to the central App Services
backend instance for your mobile or web application.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before you begin, you must be logged in as a ``Project Owner`` in a 
`Atlas <https://cloud.mongodb.com/user/register?tck=docs_realm>`_ account.
You can learn more about creating an Atlas account in the
:atlas:`Atlas Getting Started </getting-started>`
documentation.

Procedure
---------

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Navigate to the App Services Tab

      Go to the Project Dashboard where you want to create the App.
      Select the :guilabel:`App Services` tab.


   .. step:: Create a new App

      If you are creating your first App in this {+atlas-short+}
      project, you will be shown all the :ref:`template apps <template-apps>`
      available for you to start with, and an option to start without a template
      (:guilabel:`Build your own App`).

      .. figure:: /images/template-apps.png

         :width: 600px

      If you have already created at least one App
      in this {+atlas-short+} project, You can choose between two create buttons at
      the top right of the :guilabel:`App Services` tab

      .. tabs::

       .. tab:: Create App from Template
          :tabid: template

          Click the :guilabel:`Create App from Template` button
          to see a dropdown menu with all the template apps and pick one that suits your needs.

   .. step:: Configure your App

      You will be shown a dialog where you can configure your App, including the:

      - **Application Name**.

        .. include:: /includes/note-app-name-limitations.rst

      - **Linked Atlas cluster**. If you do not have a cluster in this
        project, App Services creates one for you and automatically creates a
        linked data source with the name ``mongodb-atlas``.

        .. include:: /includes/mongodb-4.4-required-for-sync-admonition.rst

      - :ref:`Deployment model <realm-deployment-models>`.

      - :ref:`Deployment region <realm-regions>`.

      Click :guilabel:`Create a New App`.

      Upon creation of your App, you will be redirected to the
      App Services console. App Services creates your app with a
      Linked Data Source named :guilabel:`mongodb-atlas`.
