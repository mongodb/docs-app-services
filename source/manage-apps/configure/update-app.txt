Overview
--------

You can update and deploy an existing {+app+}. You might want to update an
application if you prefer to develop locally when making {+app+} configuration changes.

Key Concepts
------------

In {+service+}, you can update an existing {+app+} by importing the 
application's :ref:`configuration files <app-configuration>`. The process 
to update an {+app+} also deploys it, even if you have :ref:`deployment 
drafts <deployment-draft>` enabled.

When updating an application you must import the complete application structure. 
You can't do a partial import of only one file or a single field if you're only
making a small change.

Procedure
---------

You can update and deploy your application's configuration files in two ways:

- With the :ref:`{+cli+} <deploy-cli>` 
- With :ref:`GitHub deployment <deploy-github>`

      :tabid: {+cli+}

      .. warning::

         If you're using :ref:`Automated GitHub Deploy <deploy-github>`, do not 
         update :ref:`your {+app+} configuration with the {+cli+} 
         <deploy-github-make-changes-cli>`. Instead, push your changes to the 
         linked GitHub repository.

      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Log In to MongoDB Cloud

            To configure your app with {+cli-bin+}, you must log in to MongoDB Cloud using
            an :atlas:`API key </configure-api-access/#programmatic-api-keys>` scoped to the organization or
            project that contains the app.

            .. code-block:: bash

               realm-cli login --api-key="<MongoDB Cloud Public API Key>" --private-api-key="<MongoDB Cloud Private API Key>"


         .. step:: Pull the Latest Version of Your App

            You'll need a local copy of your application's configuration files. To pull a
            local copy of the latest version of your app, run the following:

            .. code-block:: bash

               realm-cli pull --remote="<Your App ID>"

            .. tip::

               You can also download a copy of your application's configuration files
               by following the :ref:`documentation to export an {+app+} <export-realm-app>`.


         .. step:: Update Your Application

            Add, delete, and modify :ref:`configuration files <app-configuration>` for
            your application's various components.


         .. step:: Deploy the Updated App

            Once you've updated your app's configuration files, you can push them to your
            remote app. {+cli+} immediately deploys the updated configurations on push.

            .. code-block:: bash

               realm-cli push --remote="<Your App ID>"

            .. tip::

               If you have :ref:`deployment drafts <deployment-draft>`
               enabled, you'll be prompted to review and confirm your changes in the
               terminal. When you approve, {+cli+} immediately deploys the updated
               configurations.


   .. tab:: 
      :tabid: GitHub

      When you have enabled :ref:`GitHub deployment <deploy-github>`, you can
      update your application by modifying the configuration files in the
      linked GitHub repository. 

      Make any additions, modifications, or deletions to the application 
      configuration files in the linked repository. Refer to the 
      :ref:`app-configuration` reference page and individual component
      reference pages for details on the structure and schema of your 
      application directory.

      When you are ready to update the app, commit the application 
      configuration files and then push them to GitHub:

      .. code-block:: sh

        git add -A
        git commit -m "<commit message>"
        git push origin <branch name>

      Once you successfully push your changes to GitHub, {+service-short+}
      immediately deploys a new version of your application that matches the state
      of the latest commit. Client applications will automatically use the newest
      version, so make sure that you also update your client code to use the new
      version.
