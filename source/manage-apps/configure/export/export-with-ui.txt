You can export {+app+}s to a local application directory from the {+ui+}. 
Exported application directories use the name of the {+app+} and the 
application's ObjectId.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before you begin, you must be logged in as a ``Project Owner`` of the 
`{+atlas+} <https://www.mongodb.com/realm?tck=docs_realm#atlas-form-container>`_ 
project where you want to export the app. You can learn more about creating an 
|atlas| account in the :atlas:`Atlas Getting Started </getting-started>`
documentation.

Procedure
---------

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Navigate to Your {+app+}

      Go to the Project Dashboard where you want to export the {+app+}. Select
      the :guilabel:`Atlas App Services` tab. Select the tile for the {+app+} you want to export.


   .. step:: Export the App

      Click :guilabel:`Deployment` in the left-hand navigation.

      From here, there are two ways to export your app.

      1. Go to the :guilabel:`Export App` tab. Click the :guilabel:`Export App` button.
         This exports the configuration for the version of the app that is currently
         deployed.

      2. Go to the :guilabel:`History` tab. Find the version of the app you want to
         export. Go to the :guilabel:`Actions` column, and press the
         :guilabel:`Export` button for that version.
