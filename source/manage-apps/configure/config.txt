Every component of an {+service+} application is fully defined and configured
using structured JSON configuration and JavaScript source code files.

- ``.json`` files define and configure specific components in your app. Every
  JSON configuration file conforms to a specific schema for the type of
  component it configures.

- ``.js`` files define serverless application logic used in functions, triggers,
  HTTPS endpoints, and custom resolvers.

.. important:: Reserved File Names
   
   From a CLI perspective, there are a few special/reserved file names we advise
   you to avoid using for your own purposes: ``stitch.json``, ``config.json``, 
   ``realm_config.json``, and ``app_config.json``. Files with these names
   conflict with pre-made files of the same name in their app structure's file
   system. Using these file names throws an error when you import the app using the CLI.
   
You'll work directly with configuration files if you prefer to develop and
:ref:`deploy <application-deployment>` locally instead of through the {+ui+}.

A complete directory of configuration files has the following root-level files
and directories:

.. code-block:: none
   
   app/
   ├── realm_config.json
   ├── auth/
   ├── data_sources/
   ├── environments/
   ├── functions/

   ├── hosting/
   ├── http_endpoints/
   ├── log_forwarders/
   ├── services/
   ├── sync/
   ├── triggers/
   └── values/
