Overview
--------

As you develop an app, you might want to share the
codebase with team members, make a backup, or work with a
version control system like Git. App Services's export
functionality makes this possible.

Exported application directories use the same name as the App
and the application's ObjectId. Every configuration file must conform to its
:ref:`configuration file schema <app-configuration>`.

Output
------

Only entities that are configured in your application appear in your
exported application directory. See :ref:`app-configuration` for more
information on configuration files.
