Environments in Atlas App Services
----------------------------------

In App Services, an environment represents a collection of 
:ref:`environment values <environment-values>` that corresponds with a stage 
in your development process. For example, many organizations use different 
environment values for Development and Production.

When you deploy an App, you can :ref:`specify the environment 
<change-environments>` that this application represents. If you do not 
specify the environment, the App defaults to ``No Environment``. 

.. tip::

   Setting your App's environment tells App Services which 
   :ref:`environment values <environment-values>` to use. When you change the 
   environment, this changes the environment values that the App uses. 
   This is distinct from the more general :ref:`values <app-value>`, which do 
   not change when you change the app environment. 

.. _supported-environments:

Supported Environments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

App Services supports the following environments:

.. include:: /includes/list-of-environment-names.rst

Environment Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can :ref:`define environment values <define-environment-values>` directly 
in the App Services UI. You can also :ref:`import environment configuration files
<change-environments>` with {+cli+} or GitHub. In these files, you define 
environment values as JSONobjects. 

These values are specific to the environment that the app represents. For 
example, you'd store your ``Production`` environment values in a 
``production.json`` file in the ``/environments`` directory, and your 
``Development`` environment values in a ``development.json`` file. When
you specify the environment for your App, App Services uses the
corresponding environment values.

.. _environments-in-workflows:

Environments in Workflows
-------------------------

Each App represents a single environment in your development process.
This means that a typical development process is likely to have a minimum 
of three Apps at any given time; ``Development``, ``Testing``, and 
``Production``. If you use unique applications to test different feature 
branches, you might have many versions of ``Development`` and ``Testing`` 
apps -- one for each branch.

Use Environments in CI/CD
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use environments in your CI/CD pipeline. You might create an
automated process to generate a new ``Testing`` app when a developer on
your team opens a pull request to merge development work to staging.
You can use {+cli-bin+} to automate :ref:`creating a new App 
<create-app-cli>`, setting the environment to ``testing``, and :ref:`importing 
your updated app configuration <deploy-cli>`.

   and other tasks for a real application, see: `How to Build CI/CD Pipelines
