Overview
--------

When you first create an App, you must select a
:ref:`deployment type <realm-deployment-models>` that determines where
your application's data is stored and processed. You can deploy your
App globally or limit the deployment to a specific
:ref:`cloud deployment region <realm-regions>`.

Deployment Models
-----------------

.. _global-deployment:

Global Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A globally deployed app is available in multiple regions across the
world. Any global region can receive and process incoming requests for a
global app.

All write operations to a linked data source are handled within a single
region that you specify when you create the app. You can choose any
global region to handle writes, but should generally choose the region
closest to your MongoDB cluster.

Global apps are currently deployed to the following regions:

- Ireland (IE) - ``aws-eu-west-1``
- Oregon (US-OR) - ``aws-us-west-2``
- Sydney (AU) - ``aws-ap-southeast-2``
- Virginia (US-VA) - ``aws-us-east-1``

.. note::
   
   Realm SDKs automatically execute application requests, such as
   reading user information or calling a function, in the global
   deployment region that's closest to the user that issued the request.

.. _local-deployment:

Local Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A locally deployed app is available in a single cloud provider region.
All requests and MongoDB write operations are handled exclusively in the
region, which you specify when you create the app.

You can deploy to any region, but should generally choose the region
closest to your application's users.

.. _realm-regions:

Cloud Deployment Regions
------------------------

You can deploy your app to cloud regions hosted around the world by the
major cloud providers. The following regions are currently supported:
