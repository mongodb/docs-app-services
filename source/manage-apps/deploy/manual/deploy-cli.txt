Overview
--------

You can deploy changes to your {+app+} with :ref:`{+cli+} <realm-cli-quickstart>` by
importing an :ref:`application directory <app-directory>` with configuration
files that define the updated app.

Prerequisites
-------------

- A :atlas:`MongoDB Atlas programmatic API Key </configure-api-access/#programmatic-api-keys>`.

- A :ref:`properly installed <install-realm-cli>` copy of
  {+cli-bin+} that has been added to your system ``PATH``.

Procedure
---------

.. warning::

   If you're using :ref:`Automated GitHub Deploy <deploy-github>`, do not 
   update :ref:`your {+app+} configuration via the {+cli+} 
   <deploy-github-make-changes-cli>`. Instead, push your changes to the 
   linked GitHub repository.

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Log In to MongoDB Cloud

      To configure your app with {+cli-bin+}, you must log in to MongoDB Cloud using
      an :atlas:`API key </configure-api-access/#programmatic-api-keys>` scoped to the organization or
      project that contains the app.

      .. code-block:: bash

         realm-cli login --api-key="<MongoDB Cloud Public API Key>" --private-api-key="<MongoDB Cloud Private API Key>"


   .. step:: Pull the Latest Version of Your App

      You'll need a local copy of your application's configuration files. To pull a
      local copy of the latest version of your app, run the following:

      .. code-block:: bash

         realm-cli pull --remote="<Your App ID>"

      .. tip::

         You can also download a copy of your application's configuration files
         by following the :ref:`documentation to export an {+app+} <export-realm-app>`.


   .. step:: Update Your Application

      Add, delete, and modify :ref:`configuration files <app-configuration>` for
      your application's various components.


   .. step:: Deploy the Updated App

      Once you've updated your app's configuration files, you can push them to your
      remote app. {+cli+} immediately deploys the updated configurations on push.

      .. code-block:: bash

         realm-cli push --remote="<Your App ID>"

      .. tip::

         If you have :ref:`deployment drafts <deployment-draft>`
         enabled, you'll be prompted to review and confirm your changes in the
         terminal. When you approve, {+cli+} immediately deploys the updated
         configurations.
