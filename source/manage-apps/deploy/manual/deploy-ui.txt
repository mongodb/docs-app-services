Overview
--------

When you make changes to your application through the {+ui+}, those
changes are saved in a :ref:`draft state <deployment-draft>`. 
Draft changes do not affect your production application and are invisible to end users. 
This is particularly useful in situations where you need to make related changes
to multiple components in your application and want to avoid bugs and a
loss of functionality during the transition. When you want to publish
your changes, you can manually deploy them through the {+ui+}.

Procedure
---------

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Make Changes to Your Application

      Start by making any additions, modifications, or deletions that you
      want to include in the deployment through the {+ui+}.
      If you have drafts enabled, your changes will be saved automatically as a draft.

      .. seealso::

         Guide to :ref:`Disable Deployment Drafts <disable-deployment-drafts>`.

      .. note::

         You can only create draft changes through the {+ui+} or Admin
         API. Any changes that you make with GitHub or the {+cli+} are
         deployed independently of draft changes. To avoid possible conflicts or
         inconsistencies, its best to make your changes in one place at a time.


   .. step:: Review Draft Changes

      You can review all of the draft changes to your application prior to
      deploying them.

      Click :guilabel:`Deployment` in the {+leftnav+} to navigate to
      your app's deployment history table. The top row of the table
      represents all of the draft changes that you've made since the
      previous deployment.

      Click the :guilabel:`Review Draft and Deploy` button in the top row to
      see a diff of the underlying :ref:`app configuration files
      <app-config>` that represents the draft changes that you've made.

      .. note::

         You may want to download a draft of your changes because of merge conflicts
         or to save the draft outside of the UI. You can do so in the
         :guilabel:`Review Draft and Deploy` modal by clicking :guilabel:`Export State`
         in the top right corner. You can use the download to deploy your changes in the
         {+cli-bin+} or as a reference as you reapply changes in the UI.


   .. step:: Deploy a New App Version

      After you've reviewed your draft changes and confirmed that you want
      to deploy them, click :guilabel:`Deploy`. {+service-short+} deploys a
      new version of your application that includes the draft changes.
      Client applications will automatically use the newest version, so make
      sure that you also update your client code to use the new version if
      necessary.
