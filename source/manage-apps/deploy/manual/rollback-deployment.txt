Overview
--------

When you view your deployment history, you'll see the 25 most recent 
deployments. You can use the :guilabel:`Re-Deploy` button to roll back
to one of the last 25 deployments.

A re-deploy rolls back your application's configuration to match the
earlier version. It does not modify or re-deploy your :ref:`hosted files
<static-hosting>`.

Procedure
---------

.. procedure::

   .. step:: View Your App's Deployment History

      In order to roll back to a prior deploy, you'll need to navigate to your
      App Deployment History page.

      Click :guilabel:`Deployment` in the {+leftnav+} of the App Services UI. Select the
      :guilabel:`History` tab.

      You'll see the 25 most recent application deployments. The
      :guilabel:`Change Origin` column shows whether the deploy originated from
      changes in the UI, the linked GitHub repository, the Admin API, or the CLI.

   .. step:: Re-Deploy a Prior Deployment

      Selecte a prior version to roll back to and then press the
      :guilabel:`Re-Deploy` button for that version of your App.

      If you have deployment drafts enabled, you'll see a modal notifying you
      that this action will replace any changes in your current deployment
      draft with the app configuration you want to re-deploy. Press the
      :guilabel:`Re-Deploy` button to confirm.

      You'll see the banner at the top of your App notifying you that you
      have changes to deploy. Press the :guilabel:`Review Draft & Deploy` button.

      Next, you'll see a Deployment Draft that shows you a diff of the
      changes you'll apply when you complete this deploy. From here, you can
      specify a descriptive name for your deploy that will be visible in the
      :guilabel:`Deployment History` list.

      If you have :ref:`GitHub deployment <deploy-github>` enabled, you'll see
      a :guilabel:`Deploy and Push to GitHub` button. Push this button to confirm
      the rollback.

   .. step:: Confirm Rollback Success

      After the deployment completes, you'll see the deployment success banner.
      The new deployment appears in your Deployment History.

      If you have GitHub deployment enabled, it also contains a link to the
      commit in the GitHub repository.

      In the linked GitHub repository, the commit author is the
      ``mongodb-realm`` bot.
