Overview
--------

You can :ref:`deploy <application-deployment>` changes to your App with 
:ref:`App Services Admin API <admin-api>` by calling relevant HTTP endpoints 
and then creating and deploying a draft.

Prerequisites
-------------

A `MongoDB Atlas
<https://www.mongodb.com/realm?tck=docs_realm#atlas-form-container>`_
:atlas:`programmatic API key </configure-api-access/#programmatic-api-keys>`
for the MongoDB Cloud account you wish to log in with.

Procedure
---------

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Create a New Draft

      A draft represents a group of application changes that you can deploy
      or discard as a single unit. To create a draft, send a ``POST``
      request to the drafts endpoint:

      .. code-block:: shell

         curl --request POST \
           --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
           --header 'Authorization: Bearer <access_token>' \
           'https://realm.mongodb.com/api/admin/v3.0/groups/{groupId}/apps/{appId}/drafts'

      .. seealso::

         :admin-api-endpoint:`API Deployment Endpoints <tag/deploy>`

      .. important:: One Draft Per User

         Each user can only create a single draft at a time, either through
         the UI or the Admin API. If you already have an existing draft, you
         can discard the changes associated with it by sending a ``DELETE``
         request to the draft's endpoint:

         .. code-block:: shell

            curl --request DELETE \
              --header 'Authorization: Bearer <access_token>' \
              'https://realm.mongodb.com/api/admin/v3.0/groups/{groupId}/apps/{appId}/drafts/{draftId}'


   .. step:: Make Changes to Your Application

      Once you've created a draft, make all of the changes that you want to
      include in the draft. App Services adds any application changes that you
      make to the draft so that you can deploy them together.


   .. step:: Deploy the Draft

      After you've made all the changes that you want to include in the
      deployment, deploy the draft by sending a ``POST`` request to that
      draft's deployment endpoint:

      .. code-block:: shell

         curl --request POST \
           --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
           --header 'Authorization: Bearer <access_token>' \
           'https://realm.mongodb.com/api/admin/v3.0/groups/{groupId}/apps/{appId}/drafts/{draftId}/deployment'

      .. important:: Draft Conflicts

         If you deploy changes through the API but have conflicting changes in a draft in the UI,
         your UI draft will become invalid and you will not be able to deploy it.
         You can download your UI draft by reviewing the draft in the
         :guilabel:`Deployment` page. You can use the download to deploy your changes in the
         {+cli-bin+} or as a reference as you reapply changes in the UI.
