Overview
--------

:ref:`Deployment drafts <deployment-draft>` are automatically enabled in the UI, 
meaning all app changes you make in the UI are automatically saved as a draft and 
you must :ref:`manually deploy <deploy-ui>` them. This behavior can be disabled in the UI.

Procedure
---------

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Navigate to the Deployment Section

      Click :guilabel:`Deployment` in the {+leftnav+} to navigate to
      your app's deployment history table.


   .. step:: Select the Configuration Tab

      In the :guilabel:`Deployment` page select the :guilabel:`Configuration` tab at the top.


   .. step:: Disable Drafts

      In the :guilabel:`Configuration` tab, there is a section titled
      :guilabel:`Disable Drafts in {+service-short+}`. If you click :guilabel:`Disable Drafts` here,
      future changes made in the UI will be deployed immediately without a draft.
      You will no longer have the chance to review changes before deploying.

      .. note::

         This setting will not affect the ability to create drafts in the {+service-short+} API.


   .. step:: Confirm Disable Drafts

      Click :guilabel:`Disable Drafts` again in the dialog box to confirm your decision.
