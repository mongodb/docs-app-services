You can use the :ref:`{+service-short+} Admin API <admin-api>` to delete a server-side
{+app+}.

Prerequisites
-------------
A `{+atlas+}
<https://www.mongodb.com/realm?tck=docs_realm#atlas-form-container>`_
:atlas:`programmatic API key </configure-api-access/#programmatic-api-keys>`
for the MongoDB Cloud account you wish to log in with. You must be a
:atlas:`Project Owner </reference/user-roles/#project-roles>` of the 
{+atlas-short+} project where you want to delete the {+app+}.

Procedure
---------

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Authenticate a MongoDB Atlas User

      .. include:: /includes/api-authenticate-instructions.rst


   .. step:: Get the Group ID

      To delete a {+app+} you need the Project ID (sometimes referred to as
      the Group ID) of the {+atlas+} project that contains the app. You will
      include this ID in the URL of API requests.


   .. step:: Get the Application ID

      To delete an {+app+} you will need to find the Application ID of the app.

      .. include:: /includes/api-get-application-id.rst

      Find the app you want to delete and save the ``_id`` field for the last step.


   .. step:: Delete the {+app+}

      The API has an :admin-api-endpoint:`endpoint <operation/adminDeleteApplication>`
      through which you can delete an {+app+}.
      Your request should include:

      - The ``access_token`` from step 1 in a :mdn:`Bearer token <Web/HTTP/Authentication>` ``Authorization`` header.

      - The :admin-api-endpoint:`Group ID/Project ID <section/Project-and-Application-IDs>` from step 2.

      - The :admin-api-endpoint:`Application ID <section/Get-Authentication-Tokens>` from step 3.

      .. code-block:: shell

         curl --request DELETE 'https://realm.mongodb.com/api/admin/v3.0/groups/<GroupID>/apps/<ApplicationID>' \
           --header 'Authorization:  Bearer <access_token>' \
           --header 'Content-Type: application/json'

      If your application deletes successfully, the {+backend+} returns a ``204`` response.
