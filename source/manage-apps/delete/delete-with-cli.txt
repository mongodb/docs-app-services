You can use the the {+cli-ref+} to delete a server-side {+app+}.

Prerequisites
-------------

- A :ref:`properly installed <install-app-services-cli>` copy of ``{+cli-bin+}`` that has
  been added to your system ``PATH``.

- A `{+atlas+}
  <https://www.mongodb.com/realm?tck=docs_realm#atlas-form-container>`_
  :atlas:`programmatic API key </configure-api-access/#programmatic-api-keys>`
  for the MongoDB Cloud account you wish to log in with. You must be a
  :atlas:`Project Owner </reference/user-roles/#project-roles>` of the 
  {+atlas-short+} project where you want to delete the {+app+}.

Procedure
---------

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Authenticate a MongoDB Atlas User

      .. include:: /includes/cli-login.rst


   .. step:: (Optional) List All Apps

      Although the ``delete`` command will show you a list of apps available to delete,
      You may want to use the ``list`` command to see all your apps and find out which
      you plan to delete before running the ``delete`` command.

      .. code-block:: shell

         {+cli-bin+} apps list

      For more details about each app, you can use:

      .. code-block:: shell

         {+cli-bin+} apps describe

      .. seealso::

         For more details and additional flags, see the CLI documentation for the
         :ref:`list <app-services-cli-apps-list>`
         and :ref:`describe <app-services-cli-apps-describe>` commands.


   .. step:: Run the App Delete Command

      The CLI can delete one or more apps with the following command:

      .. code-block:: shell

         {+cli-bin+} apps delete

      If you have more than one {+app+}, you will be prompted to select one or
      more apps that you would like to delete from a list of all your {+app+}s.

      If you already know the name or id of the app you would like to delete, you can specify it:

      .. code-block:: shell

         {+cli-bin+} apps delete --app <name or id>

      .. seealso::

         For more details and additional flags, see the
         CLI documentation for the :ref:`delete <app-services-cli-apps-delete>` command.
