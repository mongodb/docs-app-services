Overview
--------

While Realm :ref:`data compaction <backend-compaction>` defragments the storage 
space the realm file uses on a *client*, and also reduces the size of the 
``__realm_sync`` database on Atlas clusters, it does not reduce the overall size of 
the Atlas cluster. Compacting the data on an Atlas volume involves several 
additional steps. 

Steps to Compact and Reclaim Disk Space
---------------------------------------

You should use the following guidance for reducing Atlas disk space usage:  

1. Enable Compaction in App Services

   Before reclaiming volume space, be sure that you have enabled Compaction 
   on your Atlas App Services app. You set this by setting the Max Offline Time 
   setting in the Atlas UI. For more information, see 
   :ref:`<optimize-sync-atlas-usage>`.

   .. note:: Wait for Compaction
   
      If you are enabling compaction for the first time, you will need to wait for 
      the compaction to happen before continuing. You can file a ticket with 
      support if you want to ensure compaction has completed.

#. Perform a Rolling Resync

   Perform a rolling resync of your Atlas cluster, a process explained in 
   :manual:`Resync a Member of a Replica Set <tutorial/resync-replica-set-member/>`.
   
   The commands to do this are not available with Atlas. Instead, you can 
   file a ticket with support to have this process done for you.

An Alternate Approach
---------------------

A final approach you can take for reclaiming some of your Atlas volume space
is to run the ``compact()`` command. You run it on one of the secondary nodes
and then the other secondary node(s). Finally, you perform a failover on the
primary mode and then run ``compact()``. For more information on this approach,
support-enabled customers can refer to `How to use the compact() command in
Atlas <https://support.mongodb.com/article/000019602>`__. Contact
:atlas:`Support </support>` for access.

.. note:: 

   The ``compact()`` command may not reduce the volume size as much as 
   performing a rolling resync.
