Best Practices
--------------

We recommend following these best
practices to ensure optimal performance and a smooth user experience:

Avoid breaking changes
  Once you've enabled sync, there are limitations on how you can modify your
  data model. Specifically, sync does not support breaking changes to your
  object types such as changing a given property's type. If you want to make a
  breaking change you need to terminate and re-enable sync with the updated
  data models.

Define a client reset handler
  To recover from a serious error conditions where the client and server
  histories diverge, you should define a :ref:`client reset <client-resets>`
  handler when you open each synced realm with an SDK.

Define a client maximum offline time
  The App Services backend uses a history of changes to underlying
  data to synchronize clients. Configure a :ref:`client maximum offline time
  <client-maximum-offline-time>` to control the number of days of
  history stored by your app. Clients that have not synchronized in
  more than that number of days must perform a client reset the next
  time they connect to the backend.

Deployment model and geographic regions
  Use a :ref:`local deployment model <local-deployment>` when building a
  Device Sync application. Configure your app and MongoDB data source
  to run within the same geographic region and cloud provider.

Atlas oplog
  Device Sync requires access to the :atlas:`oplog </reference/atlas-oplog>` of
  your synced cluster. For best results, keep 48 hours of oplog for a cluster
  using Device Sync.

App Services Schema Data Consistency
  If you create or modify Device Sync documents using another tool, such as the
  :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell or MongoDB Compass, be sure the documents validate 
  against the App Services Schema for the collection. For more information, see 
  :ref:`Unsynced Documents <unsynced-documents>`.

Production Load Testing
  Measure performance and identify issues in a scaled-up production
  deployment with :ref:`sync-production-load-testing`.

Write Transaction Size
  When writing large amounts of data, consider using multiple small
  write transactions instead of a single larger transaction. Depending
  on your Atlas cluster version and configuration, write transactions
  greater than 16MB may be rejected by MongoDB and cause the sync
  operation to fail.
