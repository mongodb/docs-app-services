Overview
--------

Atlas Device Sync uses space in your app's synced Atlas cluster to store 
metadata for sync. This includes a history of changes to each realm. 
Atlas App Services minimizes this space usage in your Atlas cluster via 
:ref:`trimming <trimming>` for Flexible Sync apps or 
:ref:`backend compaction <backend-compaction>` for Partition Based Sync apps.
Minimizing metadata is necessary to reduce the time and data needed for sync.

.. _sync-history:

History
-------

The App Services backend keeps a history of :ref:`changes to
underlying data <changesets>` for each realm, similar to the
:manual:`MongoDB oplog </core/replica-set-oplog/>`. App Services
uses this history to synchronize data between the backend and clients.
App Services stores history in your synced Atlas cluster.

Optimization Methods
--------------------

There are two methods for optimizing utility data synced in your cluster
depending on whether your App uses Flexible or Partition-Based Sync:

1. **Trimming**: Used for :ref:`Flexible Sync <flexible-sync>` apps.
#. **Backend Compaction**: Used for :ref:`Partition Based Sync <partition-based-sync>` apps.

.. _trimming:

Trimming
~~~~~~~~

When you set a client maximum offline time in an App that uses :ref:`Flexible
Sync <flexible-sync>`, **trimming** deletes changes older than the client
maximum offline time. 

.. note::

   Flexible Sync uses :ref:`trimming <trimming>` instead of 
   :ref:`backend compaction <backend-compaction>`.

.. _backend-compaction:

Backend Compaction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Backend compaction** is a maintenance process that automatically
runs for all apps using :ref:`Partition Based Sync <partition-based-sync>`.
Apps using Partition Based Sync store the entire history of data changes.
Using compaction, the backend optimizes a
realm's history by removing unneeded changesets. The process
removes any instruction whose effect is later overwritten by a newer
instruction.

.. example::

   Consider the following realm history:

   .. code-block::
      :caption: Original History

      CREATE table1.object1
      UPDATE table1.object1.x = 4
      UPDATE table1.object1.x = 10
      UPDATE table1.object1.x = 42

   The following history would also converge to the same state, but
   without unneeded interim changes:

   .. code-block::
      :caption: Compacted History

      CREATE table1.object1
      UPDATE table1.object1.x = 42

.. note:: 
   
   :ref:`Partition Based Sync <partition-based-sync>` uses backend compaction rather 
   than :ref:`trimming <trimming>` and 
   :ref:`client maximum offline time <client-maximum-offline-time>`.

.. _client-maximum-offline-time:

Client Maximum Offline Time
---------------------------

Used in trimming, the **client maximum offline time** controls the age limit of history.
This indirectly changes how long a client can remain offline between
synchronization sessions with the backend. Clients that do not
synchronize for more than the specified number of days
may experience a :ref:`client reset <client-resets>` the next time they
connect with the backend.

Setting the client maximum offline time to a lower value will decrease the amount 
of history required by sync. The resulting optimization lowers storage usage 
in the synced Atlas cluster.

New Apps automatically enable client maximum offline time with a default
value of 30 days.

.. warning:: Client Maximum Offline Time Causes Permanent Changes to History

   Client maximum offline time enables trimming for
   older history. This permanently changes affected
   history, and can cause client resets in the future even after
   disabling the feature.

Key Concepts
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sync should always converge at the same end state on all clients. In
order to converge during a sync, clients require the full history of
changes beginning immediately after their last sync. When a client does
not sync for a long period of time, trimming can
alter the history in ways that prevent the client from converging. Since
synchronization relies on all clients converging on a common result,
such a client cannot synchronize.

As a result, the client must complete a client reset before it can
resume synchronization. In a client reset scenario, the client deletes
the client-local copy of a realm and downloads the current state of
that realm from the backend. Synchronization then resumes using the
new copy of the realm.

The client maximum offline time controls how long your backend waits
before applying trimming. After the specified number
of days without syncing, clients may experience a client reset the next
time they connect with the backend.

Applications that do not specify the client maximum offline time never
apply trimming. This means that clients can connect
after any period of time offline -- weeks, months, or even years --
and synchronize changes. As time passes, frequently-edited realms
accumulate many changes. With a large changeset, synchronization
requires more time and data usage.
   
Client Maximum Offline Time Does Not Immediately Influence Client Resets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Trimming causes permanent, irreversible changes to
history. As a result, increasing the client maximum offline time does
not *immediately* change the length of time before clients experience a
client reset. Existing history has already been changed by trimming,
requiring a client reset. New history needs time to accumulate up to
the new client maximum offline time.

Disabling the client maximum offline time feature stops additional
trimming, but history that has already been changed by
trimming will permanently cause client resets in clients.

Decreasing client maximum offline time also does not *immediately*
change the length of time before clients experience a client reset.
Client resets begin taking place earlier once the regularly scheduled
trimming job applies trimming to the newly
eligible history.

      2. You can configure the number of days for your application's
         client maximum offline time with the ``client_max_offline_days``
         property in your app's ``sync/config.json`` file:

         .. code-block:: json
            :caption: ``sync/config.json``
           
            {
               "client_max_offline_days": 42,
            }

      3. Deploy the updated app configuration with the following
         :ref:`push command <realm-cli-push>`:

         .. code-block:: bash
            :caption: Push

            realm-cli push --remote="<Your App ID>"

.. _optimizing-performance-and-storage-flexible-sync:

Optimizing Performance and Storage When Using Flexible Sync
-----------------------------------------------------------

For Flexible Sync configuration, the amount of Atlas storage space used is
directly proportional to the number of queryable fields you have set up.
Queryable fields use storage on the backing Atlas cluster. The more queryable
fields you configure, the more storage you use on the backing cluster.

If you have a large number of collections in an App, you may need to use the
same queryable field name across multiple collections. Combine this with
:ref:`permissions <permissions>` for more granular control over who can access
which collections.

.. example::

   Your app may contain 20 or 30 collections, but you want to minimize the
   number of queryable fields. You can re-use queryable fields across
   collections in order to sync objects from every collection. For example,
   "owner_id" might be a field you want to query in multiple collections, but by
   having the same field name across collections, only one queryable field is
   used.

For best performance, open a synced realm with a broad query. Then, add 
more refined queries to expose targeted sets of data in the client 
application. Slicing off working sets from a broad query provides
better performance than opening multiple synced realms using more 
granular queries.

When you configure queryable fields, consider the broad queries you use 
for Sync, and select fewer fields that support those broad queries.

.. example::

   In a to-do list app, prefer broad queries such as ``assignee == currentUser`` 
   or ``projectName == selectedProject`` for a Sync query. This gives you a 
   couple of broad fields against which to Sync documents. In the client, you 
   can further refine your query for things like tasks of a certain priority 
   or completion status to slice off a working set.

Summary
-------

- Device Sync uses space in your synced Atlas cluster to store change history.
- Backend compaction reduces the space usage of this history for Partition Based Sync apps.
- Trimming reduces the space usage for Flexible Sync apps, but can cause client resets for clients who have not connected to the backend in more than the client maximum offline time (in days).
- Flexible Sync apps that do not specify a client maximum offline time do not apply trimming, so clients of any age can sync without experiencing a client reset.
- Adding additional queryable fields to a flexible sync configuration will increase storage consumed on an Atlas Cluster. Using broad queries and selecting fewer fields that support broad queries decreases storage consumed.
