As of September 2024, Device Sync is deprecated for Atlas App Services. Device
Sync will reach end-of-life and be removed on **September 30, 2025**. If you
use Device Sync, you should migrate to alternative solution providers before
Device Sync is removed.

Edge Server, which is in preview, is also deprecated and will reach end-of-life
and be removed before **September 30, 2024**.
