Overview
--------

If you have a mobile app that uses a local realm and you want to 
convert the app to use Sync, there are a few steps you 
need to follow. You first need to set up an App
backend. Then, make code changes in your client applications.

In the following sections, you will learn to do the following on the backend:

#. Create a new App in {+atlas+},
#. Configure at least one authentication provider
#. Choose a Sync type.

And then, in your client app, you will:

#. Update your Realm object models,
#. Connect to the new synced realm with a sync configuration file,
#. Authenticate the user.

Finally, if needed, you will also need to copy your local data to the new
synced realm.

Create an App
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To sync your data between devices and {+atlas+}, you first need to create
an {+app+}. This App provides a gateway to the data and data security
in the form of user authentication, data encryption, and access control.

To get started creating the backend app, follow the steps in 
:ref:`<create-a-realm-app>`.

Enable Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sync requires authenticated users. App Services provides
many different :ref:`Authentication Providers <authentication-providers>` such
as email/password and OAuth; once you have configured one or more providers,
you can then control exactly who has access to which data.

To set up an authentication provider, choose one of the
providers and follow the configuration steps for the provider(s)
of your choice.

Choose a Sync Type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. tabs::
   
   .. tab:: Partition Based Sync
      :tabid: pbs

      With Partition Based Sync, clients synchronize data based on
      **partitions**. When configuring Partition Based Sync, you'll choose
      a field whose discrete values represent those partitions. We call
      this field the **partition key**. To learn more about how to
      choose a partition key, see :ref:`<sync-partitions>`.

   .. tab:: Flexible Sync
      :tabid: flex

      With Flexible Sync, clients synchronize subsets of data based
      on queries to **queryable fields**. When configuring Flexible Sync,
      you'll decide which fields clients can query upon. To learn more about
      configuring flexible sync, follow the steps in :ref:`<enable-flexible-sync>`.

Update the Client App
---------------------

Now that you have the backend set up for {+sync-short+}, you need to make a few 
changes in your client app. Follow the steps in the Quick Start for your 
language/platform:

- :ref:`<java-client-quick-start-sync>`
- :ref:`<ios-client-quick-start-with-sync>`
- :ref:`<dotnet-client-quick-start>`
- :ref:`<react-native-client-quick-start>`
- :ref:`<node-client-quick-start>`

.. _copy-local-data-to-synced-realm:

Copy Existing Data
------------------

.. note:: Alternate SDK Implementations

   Some SDKs support an easier implementation for adding sync to a
   local-only realm than the steps outlined on this section.

   - :ref:`Open Non-Synced Realm as a Synced Realm - Swift SDK <ios-open-non-synced-as-synced-realm>`
   - :ref:`Open Existing Realm with Different Configuration - Node.js SDK <node-open-existing-realm-different-configuration>`
   - :ref:`Open Existing Realm with Different Configuration - React Native SDK <react-native-open-existing-realm-different-configuration>`

None of the data in your local realm automatically transfers to a
new synced realm. You must copy the data you want to preserve
to the new realm. The following diagram and steps outline the process for
copying all of the data from a local realm to a synced realm.

App Logic

   :alt: Flow chart showing the steps to convert from local to sync

#. Check if a synced realm already exists.

#. If not, create one. Open a connection to it and to the local realm.

#. Read each record from the local realm and modify it to match the schema of the
   synced realm.

#. Copy the modified record to the new synced realm. Sync automatically
   copies the record to {+atlas+} when connected to your App.

#. Confirm that all records you want to preserve are in the new realm.

#. Delete the local realm file.

#. On each subsequent app load, check if the local realm has been
   deleted.
