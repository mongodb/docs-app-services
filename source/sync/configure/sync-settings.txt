Device Sync <enable-sync>`.

Available Settings
------------------

.. _flexible-sync:

Sync Type
~~~~~~~~~

Atlas Device Sync has two sync modes: Flexible Sync and the older
Partition-Based Sync. We recommend using Flexible Sync. For information about
Partition-Based Sync, refer to :ref:`partition-based-sync`.

Flexible Sync lets you define a query in the client and sync only the objects
that match the query. With client-side subscriptions, client applications can:

- Maintain queries
- React to changes
- Add, change, or delete queries

.. _development-mode:
.. _enable-development-mode:
.. _enable-disable-development-mode:

Development Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Development Mode** is a configuration setting that allows Device Sync
to infer and update schemas based on client-side data models. This 
streamlines development, but should not be used in production.

Development Mode speeds up development by allowing you to design :ref:`schemas
<configure-your-data-model>` directly in client application code.

When you sync a realm file, Atlas App Services maps every synced object type
to its own collection in the database specified by
:ref:`sync-config-database-name`. If you update the object model on the client
side, App Services updates the collection schema to match. This lets you update
objects in your client code as you develop your app.

You can use :ref:`data access rules <sync-rules>` with Development Mode. Note
that schema changes ignore data access rules. This means that any client can
update the backend schema by changing the client model.

To learn more about how the Realm Object Schemas map to the App Services Schemas
when using Development Mode, refer to :ref:`Data Model Mapping <sync-data-model-mapping>`.

For more information about modifying synced object schemas, including how to
handle breaking changes, see: :ref:`<synced-schema-overview>`.

.. important:: Disable Development Mode for Production Apps
   
   Development mode is a development utility that is not suitable for 
   production use. Make sure that you turn off Development Mode before you 
   make your app accessible in a production environment.

.. _sync-config-data-source:

Cluster to Sync
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The name of the Atlas cluster :ref:`data source <appconfig-data_sources>` where
you want the synced data stored.

Flexible Sync requires MongoDB 5.0. You cannot use Sync with a :ref:`serverless
instance <serverless-caveats>`. In the UI, clusters display as gray and
not-selectable when they do not meet the requirements for Flexible Sync.

.. _sync-config-database-name:

Database Name (Development Mode Only)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you enable :ref:`Development Mode <development-mode>`, you specify a
database to store synced objects. App Services creates new collections in this
Development Mode database for every type of synced object.

.. example::

   Specify a Development Mode database of ``myapp``. Your iOS client has a 
   ``Person`` model. You sync a realm that contains an instance of the 
   ``Person`` object. Development Mode creates a server-side schema associated 
   with the model. The object syncs to the ``myapp.Person`` collection. 

   App Services continues creating new server-side schemas and collections 
   for each new object type. If you later add a ``Dog`` object, that object 
   will sync to a new ``myapp.Dog`` collection that App Services will
   create.

.. _queryable-fields:

Queryable Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you configure Flexible Sync, you specify field names that your client
application can query. Fields that can be used in a subscription query are
called **queryable fields**.

You can automatically specify queryable fields by enabling :ref:`Development
Mode <development-mode>`. Development Mode allows App Services to automatically
mark fields as queryable as they are used.

Queryable fields apply across all collections in an App's Schema. You
can use :ref:`rules and permissions <flexible-sync-rules-and-permissions>` to
configure more granular access control on individual collections.

The field names you provide are arbitrary strings. If an object type has a field
whose name matches a field name you provided (and meets other eligibility
criteria), that field becomes available to Device Sync to query.

.. example::

   In a to-do list app, you might set ``assignee`` or ``owner`` 
   as queryable fields. On the client side, you can then query for tasks 
   whose ``assignee`` or ``owner`` matches the logged-in user. 

.. _flexible-sync-eligible-field-types:

Eligible Field Types
````````````````````

Flexible Sync only supports top-level primitive fields with a scalar type as 
queryable fields. You can also include arrays of these primitives as queryable 
fields. Flexible Sync does not support embedded objects or arrays of 
objects as queryable fields.

.. seealso:: Realm Query Language - Flexible Sync Limitations

   For information on the queries you can perform on these fields, see:
   :ref:`flexible-sync-rql-limitations`

.. _flexible-sync-reserved-field-names:

Reserved Field Names
````````````````````

.. include:: /includes/reserved-field-names.rst

Performance and Storage
```````````````````````

Each queryable field adds additional metadata storage to your Atlas cluster and
may lead to degraded write performance. You should have as few queryable fields
as needed by your application. A good rule of thumb is to have at most 10
queryable fields.

.. seealso::

   Learn more about :ref:`optimizing performance and storage when using Flexible Sync <optimizing-performance-and-storage-flexible-sync>`.

Consequences of Adding or Removing Queryable Fields
```````````````````````````````````````````````````

You can :ref:`update your Sync configuration <alter-your-sync-configuration>` to
add or remove queryable field names, but be aware of the following:

When you add a queryable field, devices can only sync on that field once the
device has caught up to the point in time in :ref:`Device Sync History
<sync-history>` where the field was added. 

When you remove a queryable field, any devices still using that field will have
their Device Sync session dropped and must perform a :ref:`client reset
<client-resets>`. Clients not using the removed field won't receive any errors.
To avoid triggering a client reset when you remove the queryable field, you
should first remove usage of that field on the client-side.


Permissions
~~~~~~~~~~~

Atlas Device Sync enforces role-based data access rules for all requests to a
synced cluster. Rules are dynamic :ref:`JSON expressions <expressions>` that
determine a user's ability to sync, view, and modify data.

For details, see :ref:`sync-permissions`.

.. _asymmetric-sync:
.. _optimize-data-ingest:

Data Ingest
~~~~~~~~~~~

Data Ingest is a sync strategy for applications with heavy client-side
insert-only workloads. You can enable it for one or more collections. It
supports writing to any collection type, including an Atlas time-series
collection.

For example, an IoT app that frequently logs sensor data has a significant write
workload and no read workload. The device may also be offline for extended
periods of time. Data Ingest bypasses some of the processing required for
bi-directional sync, significantly improving write speed to an Atlas collection.

Other use cases include writing immutable data, such as invoices from a retail
app, or logging application events, neither of which requires conflict
resolution.

You can apply Data Ingest to individual collections. This means your app can
use Data Ingest to write some data, but bi-directional Flexible Sync on
other collections.

Data Ingest collections are only for writing data. You cannot use Flexible
Sync queries against these collections. Instead, use :ref:`data-sources`.

After you have enabled Data Ingest, you implement it in the client app via
the client SDKs. Currently, the following Realm SDKs support Data Ingest:

- C++ SDK: :ref:`cpp-stream-data-to-atlas`
- .NET SDK: :ref:`dotnet-data-ingest`
- Kotlin SDK: :ref:`kotlin-stream-data-to-atlas`
- Node.js SDK: :ref:`node-define-an-asymmetric-object`
- React Native SDK: :ref:`react-native-define-an-asymmetric-object`
- Swift SDK: :ref:`swift-stream-data-to-atlas`

Client Max Offline Time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Client Maximum Offline Time determines how long the client can be offline
between sync sessions. Changing this value enables you to balance offline access
with storage used in the synced Atlas cluster. For more information, refer to
:ref:`client-maximum-offline-time`.

Client Recovery
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Client Recovery enables the client to attempt to automatically perform a client
reset while recovering data on the device. For more information, refer to
:ref:`recover-unsynced-changes`.

.. _appconfig-sync:
.. _sync-configuration-reference:

Sync Configuration File Reference
---------------------------------

You can find the Sync configuration file for your application in the ``sync``
directory of an :ref:`exported <export-app>` app:

.. code-block:: none
   
   app/
   └── sync/
       └── config.json

For example, the following Sync configuration applies to apps using Flexible
Sync (recommended). If you are using the older Partition-Based Sync, refer to
:ref:`partition-based-sync-config-object`.

.. code-block:: json
   :caption: sync/config.json

   {
     "type": "flexible",
     "development_mode_enabled": <Boolean>,
     "service_name": "<Data Source Name>",
     "database_name": "<Development Mode Database Name>",
     "state": <"enabled" | "disabled">,
     "client_max_offline_days": <Number>,
     "is_recovery_mode_disabled": <Boolean>,
     "queryable_fields_names": [
       <Array of String Field Names>
     ],
     "permissions": "<Deprecated, Do Not Use>"
   }

The deprecated ``permissions`` field might still appear in your exported app's
configuration. That might indicate your app has not automatically migrated to
the :ref:`unified rule system yet <unified-rule-migration>`. Please avoid
deleting this field until your app has been migrated.

.. _flexible-sync-config-object:

Sync Config Object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 40

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - | ``type``
       | String
     
     - The sync mode. There are two Sync modes: Flexible Sync and the older
       Partition-Based Sync. We recommend using Flexible Sync. For more
       information about Partition-Based Sync, refer to
       :ref:`partition-based-sync`.
       
       Valid Options for a Flexible Sync Configuration:

       - ``"flexible"``

   * - | ``development_mode_enabled``
       | Boolean
     
     - If ``true``, :ref:`Development Mode <development-mode>` is enabled
       for the application. While enabled, App Services automatically stores synced
       objects in a specific database (specified in ``database_name``) and
       mirrors objects types in that database's collection schemas.

   * - | ``service_name``
       | String
     
     - The name of the Atlas cluster :ref:`data source <appconfig-data_sources>`
       to sync. You cannot use sync with a :ref:`serverless instance
       <serverless-caveats>`.

   * - | ``database_name``
       | String
     
     - The name of a database in the synced cluster where App Services stores data in
       :ref:`Development Mode <development-mode>`. App Services automatically
       generates a schema for each synced type and maps each object type to a
       collection within the database.

   * - | ``state``
       | String
     
     - The current state of the sync protocol for the application.
       
       Valid Options:

       - ``"enabled"``
       - ``"disabled"``

   * - | ``client_max_offline_days``
       | Number
     
     - Controls how long the :ref:`backend compaction <optimize-sync-atlas-usage>`
       process waits before aggressively pruning metadata that some clients
       require to synchronize from an old version of a realm.

   * - | ``is_recovery_mode_disabled``
       | Boolean
     - If ``false``, :ref:`Recovery Mode <recover-unsynced-changes>` is enabled
       for the application. While enabled, Realm SDKs that support this feature 
       attempt to recover unsynced changes upon performing a client reset.
       Recovery mode is enabled by default.

   * - | ``queryable_fields_names``
       | Array<String>
     
     - The :ref:`names of the fields <queryable-fields>` that your client 
       application can query to determine which data to synchronize.

   * - | ``last_disabled``
       | Number
     
     - The date and time that sync was last paused or disabled, represented by
       the number of seconds since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970, 00:00:00
       UTC).
