This page explains the settings available when you :ref:`enable or configure
Device Sync <enable-sync>`.

Available Settings
------------------

Sync Type
~~~~~~~~~

Atlas Device Sync has two sync modes: Flexible Sync and the older
Partition-Based Sync. We recommend using Flexible Sync. For information about
Partition-Based Sync, refer to :ref:`partition-based-sync`.

Flexible Sync lets you define a query in the client and sync only the objects
that match the query. With client-side subscriptions, client applications can:

- Maintain queries
- React to changes
- Add, change, or delete queries

Together with rules and permissions, Flexible Sync provides a powerful way to
configure Sync around your business logic.

.. _development-mode:

Development Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Development Mode** is a configuration setting that makes Device Sync
prioritize ease of development over production safety. In particular,
Development Mode allows Device Sync to infer and update schemas based on
client-side data models.

Development Mode speeds up development by allowing you to design :ref:`schemas
<configure-your-data-model>` directly in client application code.

When you sync a {+realm+} file, Atlas App Services maps every synced object type
to its own collection in the database specified by
:ref:`sync-config-database-name`. If you update the object model on the client
side, App Services updates the collection schema to match. This lets you update
objects in your client code as you develop your app.

You can use :ref:`data access rules <sync-rules>` with Development Mode. To make
changes to the schema from a client, the user on the client must have write
access to all data.

To learn more about how the Realm Object Schemas map to the App Services Schemas
when using Development Mode, refer to :ref:`Data Model Mapping <sync-data-model-mapping>`.

For more information about modifying synced object schemas, including
how to make breaking changes, see: :ref:`<synced-schema-overview>`.

.. important:: Disable Development Mode for Production Apps
   
   Development mode is a development utility that is not suitable for 
   production use. Make sure that you turn off Development Mode before you 
   make your app accessible in a production environment.


Cluster to Sync
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The name of the Atlas cluster :ref:`data source <appconfig-data_sources>` where
you want the synced data stored.

Flexible Sync requires MongoDB 5.0. You cannot use Sync with a :ref:`serverless
instance <serverless-caveats>`. In the UI, clusters display as gray and
not-selectable when they do not meet the requirements for Flexible Sync.

.. _sync-config-database-name:

Database Name (Development Mode Only)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you enable :ref:`Development Mode <development-mode>`, you specify a
database to store synced objects. App Services creates new collections in this
Development Mode database for every type of synced object.

.. example::

   Specify a Development Mode database of ``myapp``. Your iOS client has a 
   ``Person`` model. You sync a {+realm+} that contains an instance of the 
   ``Person`` object. Development Mode creates a server-side schema associated 
   with the model. The object syncs to the ``myapp.Person`` collection. 

   App Services continues creating new server-side schemas and collections 
   for each new object type. If you later add a ``Dog`` object, that object 
   will sync to a new ``myapp.Dog`` collection that App Services will
   create.

.. _queryable-fields:

Queryable Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you configure Flexible Sync, you specify up to 10 field names that your
client application can query. Fields that can be used in a subscription query
are called **queryable fields**.

Queryable fields apply across all collections in an {+app+}'s Sync Schema. You
can use :ref:`rules and permissions <flexible-sync-rules-and-permissions>` to
configure more granular access control on individual collections.

The field names you provide are arbitrary strings. If an object type has a field
whose name matches a field name you provided (and meets other eligibility criteria), that field becomes available to
Device Sync to query.

.. example::

   In a task tracker app, you might set ``assignee`` or ``owner`` 
   as queryable fields. On the client side, you can then query for tasks 
   whose ``assignee`` or ``owner`` matches the logged-in user. 

.. _flexible-sync-eligible-field-types:

Eligible Field Types
````````````````````

Flexible Sync only supports top-level primitive fields with a scalar type as 
queryable fields. You can also include arrays of these primitives as queryable 
fields. Flexible Sync does not support embedded objects or arrays of 
objects as queryable fields.

.. seealso:: {+rql+} - Flexible Sync Limitations

   For information on the queries you can perform on these fields, see:
   :ref:`flexible-sync-rql-limitations`

.. _flexible-sync-reserved-field-names:

Reserved Field Names
````````````````````

.. include:: /includes/reserved-field-names.rst

Performance and Storage
```````````````````````

Queryable fields use storage on the backing Atlas cluster. The more queryable
fields you configure, the more storage you use on the backing cluster. You can
configure up to 10 queryable fields per application for Flexible Sync.

.. seealso::

   Learn more about :ref:`optimizing performance and storage when using Flexible Sync <optimizing-performance-and-storage-flexible-sync>`.


Permissions
~~~~~~~~~~~

Refer to :ref:`sync-permissions`.

.. _asymmetric-sync:

Asymmetric Sync
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Asymmetric Sync is a sync strategy for applications with heavy client-side
insert-only workloads. You can enable it for one or more collections. It
supports writing to any collection type, including an Atlas time-series
collection.

For example, an IoT app that frequently logs sensor data has a significant write
workload and no read workload. The device may also be offline for extended
periods of time. Asymmetric Sync bypasses some of the processing required for
bi-directional sync, significantly improving write speed to an Atlas collection.

Other use cases include writing immutable data, such as invoices from a retail
app, or logging application events, neither of which requires conflict
resolution.

You can apply Asymmetric Sync to individual collections. This means your app can
use Asymmetric Sync to write some data, but bi-directional Flexible Sync on
other collections.

Asymmetric Sync collections are only for writing data. You cannot use Flexible
Sync queries against these collections. Instead, use :ref:`data-sources`.

After you have enabled Asymmetric Sync, you implement it in the client app via
the client SDKs. Currently, only the following SDKs support Asymmetric Sync:

- JavaScript
- React Native

Client Max Offline Time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Refer to :ref:`client-maximum-offline-time`.

Client Recovery
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Refer to :ref:`recover-unsynced-changes`.

.. _appconfig-sync:
.. _sync-configuration-reference:

Sync Configuration File Reference
---------------------------------

You can find the Sync configuration file for your application in the ``sync``
directory of an :ref:`exported <export-realm-app>` app:

.. code-block:: none
   
   app/
   └── sync/
       └── config.json

For example, the following Sync configuration applies to apps using Flexible
Sync (recommended). If you are using the older Partition-Based Sync, refer to
:ref:`partition-based-sync-config-object`.

Root Object
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _flexible-sync-config-object:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 40

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - | ``type``
       | String
     
     - The sync mode. There are two Sync modes: Flexible Sync and the older
       Partition-Based Sync. We recommend using Flexible Sync. For more
       information about Partition-Based Sync, refer to
       :ref:`partition-based-sync`.
       
       Valid Options for a Flexible Sync Configuration:

       - ``"flexible"``

   * - | ``development_mode_enabled``
       | Boolean
     
     - If ``true``, :ref:`Development Mode <development-mode>` is enabled
       for the application. While enabled, App Services automatically stores synced
       objects in a specific database (specified in ``database_name``) and
       mirrors objects types in that database's collection schemas.

   * - | ``service_name``
       | String
     
     - The name of the Atlas cluster :ref:`data source <appconfig-data_sources>`
       to sync. You cannot use sync with a :ref:`serverless instance
       <serverless-caveats>`.

   * - | ``database_name``
       | String
     
     - The name of a database in the synced cluster where App Services stores data in
       :ref:`Development Mode <development-mode>`. App Services automatically
       generates a schema for each synced type and maps each object type to a
       collection within the database.

   * - | ``state``
       | String
     
     - The current state of the sync protocol for the application.
       
       Valid Options:

       - ``"disabled"``

   * - | ``client_max_offline_days``
       | Number
     
     - Controls how long the :ref:`backend compaction <optimize-sync-atlas-usage>`
       process waits before aggressively pruning metadata that some clients
       require to synchronize from an old version of a {+realm+}.

   * - | ``is_recovery_mode_disabled``
       | Boolean
     - If ``false``, :ref:`Recovery Mode <recover-unsynced-changes>` is enabled
       for the application. While enabled, Realm SDKs that support this feature 
       attempt to recover unsynced changes upon performing a client reset.
       Recovery mode is enabled by default.

   * - | ``permissions.rules``
       | Object
     
     - An object where the keys are object type names and the values are arrays
       of :ref:`Rules Objects <appconfig-sync-type-specific-roles>`.

          {
            "<Type Name>": [ <Role>, ... ]
          }

   * - | ``permissions.defaultRoles``
       | Array<Object>
     
     - An array of :ref:`Default Roles <appconfig-sync-default-roles>`.

       .. code-block:: json
          
          [ <Role>, ... ]

   * - | ``queryable_fields_names``
       | Array<String>
     
     - The :ref:`names of the fields <queryable-fields>` that your client 
       application can query to determine which data to synchronize.

   * - | ``last_disabled``
       | Number
     
     - The date and time that sync was last paused or disabled, represented by
       the number of seconds since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970, 00:00:00
       UTC).

.. _appconfig-sync-type-specific-roles:

Rules Object
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``permissions.rules`` field maps object type names to sets of roles
that apply specifically to each object type.

For more information, see :ref:`type-specific-roles`.

.. include:: /includes/tip-role-order-config-files.rst

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 40

   * - | ``name``
       | String
       | *Required*

     - The name of the role. You might use a descriptive name, such as
       ``"adminReadWrite"`` or ``"employeeReadOnly"``, to make it easier
       to understand the rules.

   * - | ``applyWhen``
       | Expression
       | *Required*
     
     - An :ref:`expression <expressions>` that evaluates to ``true``
       when the role applies to the user. 
       
       .. example::
          
          The following expression defines a role that applies when a
          :ref:`user's custom data <custom-user-data>` contains a field
          named ``isGlobalAdmin`` with the value set to ``true``:

          .. code-block:: json
             
             {
               "%%user.custom_data.isGlobalAdmin": true
             }

   * - | ``read``
       | Expression
       | *Optional*
     
     - An :ref:`expression <expressions>` that determines whether or not
       the user can read data. If the expression evaluates to ``true``,
       the user has permission to read objects of this type. If
       ``false``, the user cannot read an object or any of its
       properties. 

       If a user has write permission, they also have read permission, 
       regardless of the value of this field.

   * - | ``write``
       | Expression
       | *Optional*
     
     - An :ref:`expression <expressions>` that determines whether or not
       the user can write data. If the expression evaluates to ``true``,
       the user has permission to write objects of this type. If
       ``false``, the user cannot write an object or any of its
       properties.
   
   * - | ``fields``
       | Object
       | *Optional*
     
     - An object that defines read and write permissions for specific
       fields. A field-level permission definition has the following
       form:

       .. code-block:: json
          
          "fields": {
            "<Field Name>": {
              "read": <Boolean>,
              "write": <Boolean>,
              "fields": <Embedded Object Fields>
            }
          }

   * - | ``fields.<Field Name>.read``
       | Boolean
       | *Required*
     
     - If ``true``, the role has permission to read this field. If
       ``false``, the user cannot read the field.       
       
       If a user has write permission, they also have read permission, 
       regardless of the value of this field.

   * - | ``fields.<Field Name>.write``
       | Boolean
       | *Required*
     
     - If ``true``, the role has permission to write this field. If
       ``false``, the user cannot write the field.

   * - | ``fields.<Field Name>.fields``
       | Object
       | *Optional*
     
     - Nested field-level permissions for an embedded object.
       
       .. example::
          
          The following role defines read and write permissions for the
          embedded field ``address.street``:

          .. code-block:: json
             
             {
               "fields": {
                 "address": {
                   "fields": {
                     "street": {
                       "read": true,
                       "write": true
                     }
                   }
                 }
               }
             }
   
   * - | ``additional_fields``
       | Object
       | *Optional*
     
     - An object that defines read and write permissions for all fields
       that do not have any permissions defined in ``fields``. A
       field-level permission definition for generic fields has the
       following form:

       .. code-block:: json
          
          "additional_fields": {
            "read": <Boolean>,
            "write": <Boolean>
          }
   
   * - | ``additional_fields.read``
       | Boolean
       | *Required*
     
     - If ``true``, the role has permission to read any field that
       isn't defined in ``fields``. If ``false``, the user can only
       read a field with specific permissions.

       If a user has write permission, they also have read permission, 
       regardless of the value of this field.

   * - | ``additional_fields.write``
       | Boolean
       | *Required*
     
     - If ``true``, the role has permission to write any field that
       isn't defined in ``fields``. If ``false``, the user can only
       write a field with specific permissions.

.. _appconfig-sync-default-roles:

Default Roles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``permissions.defaultRoles`` field contains an array of generic
roles that apply to all object types. Type-specific roles defined in the
``rules`` property always take precedence over default roles. A user may
be assigned a default role when type-specific roles do not apply or are
not defined.
       
For more information, see :ref:`Default Roles <default-roles>`.

.. include:: /includes/tip-role-order-config-files.rst

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 40

   * - | ``name``
       | String
       | *Required*

     - The name of the role in the ``defaultRoles`` array. You might 
       use a descriptive name to make it easier to parse the roles, such as 
       "adminReadWrite" or "employeeReadOnly".

   * - | ``applyWhen``
       | Expression
       | *Required*

     - An :ref:`expression <expressions>` that evaluates to ``true`` when 
       the role should be applied. An example might be 
       ``{"%%user.custom_data.isGlobalAdmin": true}``. This reads the 
       value of the ``isGlobalAdmin`` bool from the :ref:`user's custom data 
       <custom-user-data>`, and applies the role when the value of this 
       bool is ``true``.

   * - | ``read``
       | Expression
       | *Optional*
     
     - An :ref:`expression <expressions>` that determines whether or not
       the user can read data. If the expression evaluates to ``true``,
       the user has permission to read objects. If ``false``, the user
       cannot read an object or any of its properties.

       If a user has write permission, they also have read permission, 
       regardless of the value of this field.

   * - | ``write``
       | Expression
       | *Optional*
     
     - An :ref:`expression <expressions>` that determines whether or not
       the user can write data. If the expression evaluates to ``true``,
       the user has permission to write objects. If ``false``, the user
       cannot write an object or any of its properties.
