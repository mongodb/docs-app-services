Overview
--------

You might want to alter your Atlas Device Sync configuration after you have
already :ref:`enabled Device Sync <enable-realm-sync>`. You can alter a Flexible
Sync Configuration in the App Services UI without needing to terminate and
re-enable Sync.

If you are using the older Partition-Based Sync mode, refer to
:ref:`alter-partition-based-sync-config`.

.. add-a-queryable-field:

Add a Queryable Field
---------------------

To add a queryable field, navigate to the :guilabel:`Device Sync` configuration screen
through the {+leftnav+}. Under the :guilabel:`Select Queryable Fields` heading,
you can create a new field(s) to construct a query on. Finally, make sure to
click :guilabel:`Enable Device Sync` to finish adding your queryable field and enable
Device Sync.

.. note:: 

   Devices using this new field will only be able to Device Sync on this field once the
   device has caught up to the point in time in :ref:`Device Sync History <sync-history>`
   where the field was added.

.. remove-a-queryable-field:

Remove a Queryable Field
------------------------

To remove a queryable field, navigate to the :guilabel:`Sync` configuration
screen through the {+leftnav+}. Under the :guilabel:`Select Queryable Fields`
heading, you can click the :guilabel:`x` button next to the field you wish to
delete. Finally, make sure to click :guilabel:`Enable Device Sync` to finish adding
your queryable field and enable Device Sync.

.. note:: Removing a Queryable Field Triggers a Client Reset on Devices Using That Field

   When you remove a queryable field, any devices still using that field will
   have their Device Sync session dropped and receive a client reset. To learn more
   about handling client resets, read the :ref:`client reset <client-resets>`
   documentation. Clients that are not using this field, will continue syncing
   data normally without receiving any errors. To avoid triggering a client
   reset when you remove the queryable field in the :guilabel:`Device Sync`
   configuration screen, you should also remove this field on the client-side.

.. flexible-sync-permission-changes:

Permission Changes
------------------

Making changes to permissions, whether implicitly through user metadata, or
explicitly through changing configuration filters, will trigger a client reset
and re-download of all Device Sync data with the new permissions applied. 

A client reset will not be triggered under the following cases: 

- Adding a new collection to a App Services Schema, and defining permissions for the new namespace or using default roles. This will not trigger a client reset because permissions have not been applied previously.
- Configuring custom permissions for the new collection in the same :ref:`draft <deploy-ui>` as the new schema. Conversely, deploying a draft with permission changes after you deploy the schema will lead to a client reset, since default permissions were applied in the initial deployment.
