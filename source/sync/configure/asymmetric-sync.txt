Overview
--------

Asymmetric Sync is a flexible sync strategy that is optimized for applications 
with heavy client-side write workloads. You enable it for one or more collections, 
including an {+atlas-short+} time-series collection.

For example, an IoT app that frequently logs sensor data has a significant 
write workload, and essentially no read workload. The device may also be offline 
for extended periods of time. Asymmetric sync bypasses some of the processing 
required for bi-directional sync, significantly improving writes to a 
{+atlas-short+} collection. 

Other use cases include writing non-mutable data, such as invoices from as retail 
app, or logging application events, neither of which requires conflict 
resolution.

.. important:: Flexible Sync Only

   Asymmetric sync is part of Flexible Sync and therefore cannot be used in 
   applications that use Partition-Based sync.

Configuring Asymmetric Sync
---

When enabling Asymmetric sync, you choose one or more collections to 
use. By selecting individual collections, you ensure that the other sync 
collections continue to use the default bi-directional sync. 

To enable and configure Asymmetric sync, follow these steps:

1. In the {+leftnav+}, select :guilabel:`Sync`. 

#. :ref:`Enable and configure Flexible Sync <enable-flexible-sync>`.

#. Expand the :guilabel:`Advanced Configuration` section. 

#. The dropdown under the :guilabel:`Asymmetric Sync` heading shows the tables  
   that you can select for this purpose. When you select a table, it is 
   listed immediately below the dropdown. 
   
#. You can also create a new collection if you have Dev Mode enabled. When you 
   select the dropdown, you can type in the name of the new collection, and 
   {+backend-short+} creates the collection automatically. 

Using Asymmetric Sync
---

After you have enabled Asymmetric Sync, your implement it in the client app 
via the appropriate SDK.

.. TODO => links to each SDK and add note about which SDKs do not yet support it.
