While your app is in development, you can use Development Mode to simplify
the process of updating your Device Sync data model in an eligible app. 

**Development Mode** is a Device Sync configuration setting that lets Sync
automatically infer and update the server-side App Services schema based on your
client-side changes - including breaking changes. 

For more information on Development Mode and other Device Sync settings, refer 
to :ref:`development-mode`. 

.. include:: /includes/note-dev-mode-production.rst

For information on how to update data models when Development Mode is disabled, refer to :ref:`update-data-model-production-apps`.

Breaking Changes in Development Mode
------------------------------------

Non-breaking changes (or additive changes) don't require any additional handling, even with
Development Mode disabled. You can typically make these change to your server-side App
Services schema or to your client-side object model with some exceptions. For
more information, refer to the :ref:`breaking-change-quick-reference`.

Breaking changes (or destructive changes) require additional handling
depending on what the change is and where they are made. However, when Development Mode is enabled, and you make
breaking changes to your client-side SDK object model, then Device Sync
automatically handles the server-side updates for you.
You *must* make your updates to the client for Sync to automatically update the
server-side schema with the breaking changes. 

For more information on the types of data model changes and how
Device Sync handles them, refer to :ref:`synced-schema-overview`.

.. _update-data-model-development-mode-prerequisites:

Prerequisites
-------------

To make breaking changes to your client-side object model using Development 
Mode, your App Services App must meet the following requirements:

- The App is created *after* September 13, 2023, and has the following enabled: 
  
  - Device Sync. To learn how, refer to :ref:`enable-sync`.
  - Development Mode. To learn how, refer to :ref:`enable-development-mode`.
   
    .. warning:: Enabling Development Mode Deletes Schema Version History

      You *cannot* use schema versioning in Development Mode. If you enable
      Development Mode for an existing app, schema versioning is automatically disabled and any
      version history is cleared. 
      
      When you disable Development Mode, schema versioning is automatically
      re-enabled but the app's previous version history is unrecoverable.

- The App uses a minimum Device SDK version:

  - C++ SDK v1.0.0
  - Flutter SDK v1.6.0
  - Java SDK v10.16.2
  - Kotlin SDK v11.1.1
  - .NET SDK v11.6.0
  - Node.js SDK v12.2.0
  - React Native SDK v12.2.0
  - Swift SDK v10.42.2

For apps created *before* September 13, 2023, you must manually update your
object schema in the App Services UI. For more information, refer to
:ref:`migrate-schema-partner-collection`.

.. tip:: Contact Support to Enable in Older Apps
   
   You can contact support if you are interested in enabling this feature in an 
   app created before September 13, 2023 that can meet the other requirements.

Make Breaking Changes From Client-Side Object Model
---------------------------------------------------

The following describes how to make breaking changes to your client-side object
model with Development Mode.

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Delete Client Data

      To ensure that Sync can overwrite the current server-side schema and apply
      all changes received from the client, you must connect to Sync with an
      empty synced realm. This means that you must delete all local data before
      updating your data model:

      1. Sync all local changes to the backend.
      2. Delete your local ``.realm`` database file and client data. Any local
         changes that were not already synced are unrecoverable.

      To learn how to delete your local database file, refer to the following 
      SDK documentation:

      - C++ SDK - not currently supported
      - :ref:`Flutter SDK - Delete a Realm <flutter-delete-realm>`
      - :ref:`Kotlin SDK - Delete a Realm <kotlin-delete-a-realm>`
      - :ref:`Java SDK - deleteRealm method <io_realm_Realm_deleteRealm>`
      - :ref:`.NET SDK - Delete a Realm <dotnet-delete-a-realm>`
      - :js-sdk:`Node.js SDK - Realm.deleteFile method <Realm.html#.deleteFile>`
      - :js-sdk:`React Native SDK - Realm.deleteFile method <Realm.html#.deleteFile>`
      - :ref:`Swift SDK - Delete a Realm <swift-delete-a-realm>`

   .. step:: Edit Your SDK Object Model

      Make the desired changes to your client-side objects. Updates can
      include both breaking and non-breaking schema
      changes.

      For information on the specific changes you can make, refer to 
      :ref:`sync-schema-overview`.

   .. step:: Open Empty Synced Database and Sync Changes

      Open an empty synced database, then run your
      client app to sync your updated data model to the backend.

      Once your client app connects, Sync overwrites the existing server-side
      App Services schema with the updated client-side object
      model.

      For more information on opening a synced database, refer to the following SDK documentation:

      - :ref:`C++ SDK - Open a Synced Realm <cpp-open-synced-realm>`
      - :ref:`Flutter SDK - Open a Synced Realm <flutter-open-synced-realm>`
      - :ref:`Kotlin SDK - Configure & Open a Synced Realm <kotlin-open-a-synced-realm>`
      - :ref:`Java SDK - Configure a Synced Realm <java-open-a-synced-realm>`
      - :ref:`.NET SDK - Configure & Open a Synced Realm <dotnet-configure-and-open-a-synced-realm>`
      - :js-sdk:`Node.js SDK - Configure & Open a Synced Realm <node-open-a-synced-realm>`
      - :js-sdk:`React Native SDK - Configure a Synced Realm <react-native-open-a-synced-realm>`
      - :ref:`Swift SDK - Configure & Open a Synced Realm <ios-configure-and-open-a-synced-realm>`

Troubleshooting 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You might encounter the following errors:

- **[ERROR TBD]**
  If any documents stored in Atlas do *not* match the uploaded client-side
  object model, they cannot be synced to the client. An
  error message is sent to the client with instructions on how to sync these 
  documents.

- **Changes cannot be made in additive-only schema mode**
  If the client still has data in its local database file after you make a
  breaking change, the app will fail at startup with an error indicating
  that the ``changes cannot be made in additive-only schema mode``. Ensure
  that you delete any existing local data before making your changes.
