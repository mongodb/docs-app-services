After your app goes to production, you might need to make additional updates to
you data model. However, data model changes in a production app require careful
planning and execution to avoid data loss and ensure that existing clients can
successfully reconnect.

If your app is still in development, we recommend using Development Mode
to update your data model. To learn how, refer to
:ref:`update-data-model-development-mode`.

.. _schema-versioning:

Schema Versioning
-----------------

**Schema versioning** is a Device Sync feature for production apps that enables
versioning for your server-side schema as you make changes.

Schema versioning changes are a subset of breaking changes. When you make a
schema versioning change to your server-side schema, App Services creates a new
backward-compatible schema version.

When the new schema version is deployed, App
Services provides a server-initiated migration path that automatically handles
existing clients in a backward-compatible way. This ensures that devices on
older versions can still sync with the Device Sync server and other SDK devices,
ensuring data consistency across versions.

.. important:: Schema Versioning is Incompatible with Development Mode

   You must :ref:`disable Development Mode <enable-development-mode>` to use
   schema versioning in your app.

   While Development Mode is enabled, App Services disables schema versioning considers schema versioning changes to be breaking changes.

   Additionally, if you enable Development Mode in an app with versioned
   schemas, App Services deletes all existing versions. This will break any
   clients using a versioned schema.

.. So the gist is for production
both breaking and nonbreaking changes require schema update for both the client and the app
nonbreaking changes don’t need further action other than the client update with the new model
breaking changes necessitate client reset following sync terminate/restart and/or data cleansing in Atlas as well

.. For supported Atlas Device SDKs, you have the option to set the schema version
.. from the client code. Note that this is not a requirement; you can use schema
.. versioning with SDKs that don't support this feature.

.. TODO: update with links to supported SDK docs once they're available
For more information, refer to the following SDK documentation:

- C++ SDK: v2.0.0 or later
- Flutter SDK: v2.2.0 or later
- Kotlin SDK: version TBD
- .NET SDK: v12.1.0 or later
- Node.js SDK: version TBD
- React Native SDK: version TBD
- Swift SDK: version TBD

This feature is *not* supported in the Java SDK. Use the Kotlin SDK instead.

Non-Breaking Changes in Production
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once your app is in production, you can make :ref:`non-breaking changes
<non-breaking-changes-overview>` to your server-side schema or to your
client-side data model, then update the corresponding side without additional
action. However, note that some changes are only considered non-breaking when
made to the client-side model. To see which changes, check out the
:ref:`breaking-change-quick-reference`.


- both breaking and nonbreaking changes require schema update for both the client and the app
nonbreaking changes don't need further action other than the client update with the new model
breaking changes necessitate client reset following sync terminate/restart
and/or data cleansing in Atlas as well
and... adding non-required fields to a schema in Atlas means that not only is it a nonbreaking change, but existing apps don't need an update. You can keep version 1 of your client app in the field with the old schema while version 2 of the client app can be rolled out with the new schema.

.. Non-Breaking Changes to Client-Side Model
.. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. The following changes are non-breaking when made to your client-side model:

.. - Adding a new object type
.. - Adding a new property
.. - Adding a default value on an existing property
.. - Removing an object type
.. - Removing a property

Non-Breaking Changes to Server-Side Schema
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following changes are non-breaking when made to your server-side schema:

- Adding a new object type
- Adding a new property
- Adding a default value on a property

When you make a non-breaking change to your server-side schema, the change is
applied to the current schema version without creating a new version.

.. note:: Clients on Lower Schema Version Cannot Access Added Elements

   Because non-breaking changes don't create a new version, clients must use a
   schema version equal to or greater than the current version to reference any
   elements added as part of your changeset.


Breaking Changes in Production
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once your app is in production, breaking changes require you to
terminate Device Sync. This blocks any clients that previously connected to
Atlas from reconnecting. To restore connectivity, you must
re-enable Sync, then implement a client reset handler. For more information, refer to :ref:`client-resets`.

Because this process risks significant downtime, negative impacts to existing
clients, and potential data loss, we recommend that you only make breaking
changes in a production app when absolutely necessary.

If you determine that a breaking change is needed, you can choose one of the
following strategies to apply the desired changes, depending on your tolerance
for data loss and backward compatibility:

-  Update your data model directly with the breaking change, then perform a
   client reset to restore connectivity with existing client devices.

   .. important:: Existing Clients Lose Unsynced Data After Reset

      If you perform a client reset, there is *no* way to migrate data from
      clients that are using an old version of the data model. If clients have
      unsynced data, that data will be lost.

-  Create a new "Partner Collection" using the desired data model, copy your old data, then set up
   triggers to ensure data consistency with existing collection. You might choose this option if you can't tolerate
   losing unsynced data or you need to maintain backward-compatibility with
   older clients that can't update you can choose to create a new "partner
   collection" schema with the desired changes. You can copy your old data to
   this new collection, then set up triggers to ensure data consistency. To
   learn more, refer to :ref:`migrate-schema-partner-collection`.


You can make :ref:`breaking changes <breaking-changes-overview>` to your
server-side schema in production. However, breaking changes *always* require
terminating and re-enabling Device Sync, which stops existing clients from
reconnecting to Atlas. To restore connectivity, you must also perform a client
reset. This process is described in more detail below

Breaking changes to a server-side schema include:

- Renaming an existing object type
- Renaming an existing property
- Changing the data type of an existing property

.. The following changes are breaking when made to your client-side model:

.. - Renaming an existing object type
.. - Renaming an existing property
.. - Changing the data type of an existing property
.. - Changing whether a property is optional or required




Regardless of whether they increment the schema version, breaking changes
*always* require terminating and re-enabling Device Sync.



Schema Versioning Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:ref:`Schema versioning changes <breaking-changes-schema-versioning-overview>`
are a special subset of breaking changes. These changes create a new
backward-compatible version of your existing App Services schema.

Schema versioning changes to a server-side schema include:

- Removing an existing object type
- Removing an existing property
- Changing whether an existing property is optional or required

To use schema versioning, your App Services App must meet the
following requirements:

- Device Sync must be enabled. To learn how, refer to :ref:`enable-sync`.
- Development Mode must be disabled. To learn how, refer to :ref:`Disable
  Development Mode <enable-development-mode>`.

To set a schema version from the client, your app must also use a minimum

  added as part of your non-breaking changeset.


.. tip:: Remap a Name Instead of Renaming

   Several Device SDKs support remapping a property or class name. Because
   renaming is considered a breaking change, we recommend remapping
   through the client code when possible. To learn how, refer to the following

.. _update-data-model-production-app-procedure:

Update a Data Model in a Production App
---------------------------------------

The following describes how to make changes to your server-side schema through
the App Services UI when schema versioning is enabled.

For information on the specific updates you can make, refer to :ref:`update-your-data-model`.

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Update Your Schema in App Services UI

      1. In the left navigation menu, click :guilabel:`Schema` in the
         :guilabel:`DATA ACCESS` section.

         .. figure:: /images/schema-screen.png
            :lightbox:
            :alt: The Schema screen in the App Services UI

      #. From the :guilabel:`Collections` tab, select the collection. The schema
         editor displays the current schema for the selected collection.

      #. Do one of the following, depending on the type of changes you are making:

         .. tabs::

            .. tab:: Non-Breaking
               :tabid: additive

               1. If you are only making non-breaking changes, update the schema
                  with your changes.

               #. Do one of the following to save your changes, depending on
                  whether you are using deployment drafts in your app:

                  - If drafts are disabled, click :guilabel:`Save`.
                  - If drafts are enabled, click :guilabel:`Save Draft`. From
                    the banner, click :guilabel:`Review Draft & Deploy`.

               #. Your changes are automatically applied to the current schema
                  version, and no additional action is required. App Services
                  does not create a new schema version.

                  .. note:: Added Elements are Not Available to Previous Versions

                     Because non-breaking changes are applied to the current schema, clients
                     must use a schema version equal to or greater than the
                     current version to reference any elements added as part of
                     your changeset.

            .. tab:: Schema Versioning
               :tabid: supported

               1. If you are making schema versioning changes, update the schema
                  with your changes.

                  .. include:: /includes/tip-define-default-values.rst

               #. Do one of the following to save your changes, depending on
                  whether you are using deployment drafts in your app:

                  - If drafts are disabled, click :guilabel:`Save`.
                  - If drafts are enabled, click :guilabel:`Save Draft`. From
                    the banner, click :guilabel:`Review Draft & Deploy`.

               #. A confirmation window displays with a summary of your changes.

            .. tab:: Breaking
               :tabid: unsupported

               1. If you are making breaking changes, update the schema with
                  your changes.

                  .. note:: Define Default Values When Possible

                     If you are adding a new required property, we recommend that you define a
                     default value. To learn how, refer to
                     :ref:`schema-update-add-a-default-value`.

               #. Do one of the following to save your changes, depending on
                  whether you are using deployment drafts in your app:

                  - If drafts are disabled, click :guilabel:`Save`.
                  - If drafts are enabled, click :guilabel:`Save Draft`. From
                    the banner, click :guilabel:`Review Draft & Deploy`.

               #. A confirmation window displays with a summary of your changes.

   .. step:: Confirm and Deploy (Schema Versioning or Breaking Changes Only)

      From the confirmation window, review the :guilabel:`Schema Version` and
      :guilabel:`Change Summary` information:

      - The current schema version, and the incremented number of the
        new schema created upon deployment (if applicable).
      - The type of change, labeled as ADDITIVE, SUPPORTED, or UNSUPPORTED.
      - A description of the changes to the noted object type or field.
      - Any notes or suggested actions to take for a given change. For example,
        if App Services is expecting a default value based on the change you
        made, the note suggests that you define a default value.

      How you deploy depends on the type of changes made:

      .. tabs::

         .. tab:: Schema Versioning
            :tabid: supported

            If your changeset includes at least one schema versioning change,
            then your changes are applied to a new compatible schema version.

            1. Review your changes, and resolve any suggested actions.

            #. Click :guilabel:`Deploy` to deploy your changes.

            #. Your changes are applied to the new schema version. The new
               version is compatible with previous versions.

         .. tab:: Breaking
            :tabid: unsupported

            If your changeset includes at least one breaking change, then your
            changes are applied. The new schema is *incompatible* with all
            previous schema versions. Upon deployment, App Services terminates and re-enables Device Sync.

            1. Review your changes, and resolve any suggested actions.

               Breaking changes may or may not increment the schema version:

               - If the current schema version is greater than 0, App Services
                 indicates that the schema will increment upon deployment.
               - If the current schema version is 0, the window only displays
                 the current schema version number.

            2. Click :guilabel:`Deploy and re-initialize`. App Services
               terminates Device Sync, deploys your changes, then re-enables
               Sync.

            3. After Device Sync re-initializes, your changes are applied to a
               new schema. The new schema is not backward compatible with any
               previous versions. It becomes the new minimum schema version.

   .. step:: Handle Client Resets

            After you deploy your changes and re-enable Device Sync, you must do
            the following to ensure that clients can successfully reconnect to
            Atlas and sync data with the new schema:

            .. tabs::

               .. tab:: Schema Versioning
                  :tabid: supported

                  For schema versioning changes, App Services automatically
                  handles the client reset and migration for you.

                  To ensure App Services is able to perform the migration
                  successfully, you must open synced database on the
                  client *asynchronously*. This blocks the client from writing
                  to the synced database until after the client reset completes.

                  For more information, refer to the following
                  documentation for your preferred SDK:

                  .. TODO: add link to SDK docs

                  - C++ SDK
                  - Flutter SDK
                  - Java SDK
                  - Kotlin SDK
                  - .NET SDK
                  - Node.js SDK
                  - React Native SDK
                  - Swift SDK

               .. tab:: Breaking
                  :tabid: unsupported

                  For breaking changes, you *must* perform a client
                  reset. This is because terminating and re-enabling Device Sync
                  always requires a client reset to restore connectivity with existing clients.

                  For more information on how to handle client resets, refer to
                  :ref:`client-resets`.

View Schemas
------------

.. TODO: Link out to respective sdk procedures for setting schema version from client?

If you have multiple schema versions available, you can do the following from the App Services UI:

- View your previous schemas.
- Generate SDK data models based on previous schema versions.

#. Navigate to the :guilabel:`Device Sync` screen:

   .. include:: /includes/navigation/nav-to-device-sync-page.rst

#. Select the :guilabel:`Sync Models` tab. The :guilabel:`Sync schema version`
   dropdown field displays the current schema version by default.

#. Use the dropdown to select previous versions. Schemas are listed in version
   order and grouped by backward compatibility. When you select a different
   version, the timestamp updates to indicate the version creation date, and the generated SDK data models update to reflect the selected version.

   If you select a schema version that is not backward compatible with previous versions, a warning displays.

Troubleshooting
---------------

.. TODO: update with server-side errors (client-side errors will be updated in the SDK docs)

You might encounter one of the following errors when attempting to update your
data model:

Client provided invalid schema version
  If you try to connect a client database with a schema version
  - greater than what's supported by the app
  - Opening a Realm with a schema version less than the earliest valid version (Making breaking changes invalidates all prior schema versions)

Changes cannot be made in additive-only schema mode
  If you make a breaking change and connect a client with data in its local
  database file, the app will fail at startup with an error indicating that the
  noted ``changes cannot be made in additive-only schema mode``.

  To resolve, ensure
  that you delete all existing local data, as described above, before
  re-attempting to connect with your changes.
  (Migrating a Realm’s schema version using synchronous open)

Server schema has changed since the last time the client connected; please update your SDK version to avoid future client resets
   QBSv2 only: connecting after an additive schema change has been made on the server, AND the client doesn’t support server initiated bootstraps
