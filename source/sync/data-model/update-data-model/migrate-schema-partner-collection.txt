This page describes how to manually update a data model. It applies to App Services Apps
that do not support automatic updates through Development Mode or with schema versioning. For information on how
to automatically update a data model, refer to :ref:`synced-schema-overview`.

.. tip:: Update Data Model Automatically  
   
   When possible, we recommend that eligible apps update their data model automatically using the following Device Sync features:  

   - Automatic Client-Side Updates with Development Mode: Apps with Development
     Mode enabled can make breaking changes from client code, and Device Sync
     automatically handles the updates to the server-side App Services schema.
     Apps must be created after September 13, 2023 and meet a minimum Device SDK
     version. For more information, refer to :ref:`update-data-model-development-mode`.

   - Automatic Server-Side Updates with Schema Versioning: Apps created after
     [DATE TBD], 2024 can make breaking changes to the server-side App Services
     schema. Device Sync creates a new schema version and automatically handles the
     updates to the client object models. For more information, refer to :ref:`update-data-model-production-apps`.

   You can contact support to enable either of these features.

.. TODO: Update with the correct date once it is available. 
.. TODO: Update to note support for changes from the client code once SDKs roll out versioning.

Manual Updates: Quick Reference
-------------------------------

The following diagram shows the types of changes you can make and the 
process to manually perform the change. Each of these changes is explained 
in more detail in the table and sections below.

.. tip:: Remap a Name Instead of Renaming

   Because renaming a property or object type is a breaking change, several Device 
   SDKs support remapping a property or class name as a non-breaking workaround. For more
   details, refer to the
   :ref:`schema-update-change-property-name` section on this page.

Breaking and Non-Breaking Changes
---------------------------------

A **breaking change** is a change that requires additional action to handle
before it can be implemented. 

Breaking schema changes are tricky to manually implement and manage because clients that 
have not been updated to the updated schema still need to access
the data using old schema definitions, but updated clients need to 
work with the new schema changes as well.
As a result, breaking schema changes often mean that older clients can't 
to open a synced realm or they can give the appearance of data loss when server-side documents 
are unable to sync to client-side applications. Breaking changes can also 
prevent applications from automatically recovering from a 
:ref:`client reset <handle-a-client-reset>`.

When you make a breaking change to the server-side App Services schema, you
must either:  

- :ref:`Terminate <terminating-realm-sync>`, then :ref:`re-enable  <enable-sync>` Device Sync in the backend. 
- Create a partner collection with the desired changes, copy the old data to the
  collection, then set up triggers to ensure data consistency. This process is
  described in the :ref:`schema-partner_collection-strategy` section on this
  page.

.. include:: /includes/warn-terminate-sync-client-reset.rst

.. note:: Breaking Schema Changes Unsupported in CLI or Automated Deploy

   Because breaking schema changes require special handling, 
   App Services does not support making these changes using the {+cli+} CLI or 
   automated deploy with GitHub. You can make breaking changes through 
   the App Services UI.

A **non-breaking change** is a change that you can make in your server-side
schema or your client-side SDK object model without requiring additional handling in your
app. Also known as additive changes, they apply automatically to synced realms.

.. note:: Applying Non-Breaking Changes in Client May Require Migration

   You can make non-breaking changes to your server-side schema, then
   apply those changes to your client object model. However, if the
   client device has an existing realm file, you must
   perform a migration to apply those changes. For details, refer to the documentatino in your preferred SDK:

   - C++ SDK - migrations are currently unsupported 
   - :ref:`Flutter SDK - Update an Object Schema <flutter-update-realm-object-schema>`
   - :ref:`Java SDK - Modify an Object Schema <java-modify-an-object-schema>`
   - :ref:`Kotlin SDK - Update an Object Model <kotlin-change-object-model>`
   - :ref:`.NET SDK - Update an Object Model <dotnet-schema-versions-and-migrations>`

   - :ref:`Swift SDK - Update an Object Model <ios-modify-an-object-schema>`

Change Types
------------

.. _schema-update-add-object-type:

Add an Object Type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can add an object type to either the server-side schema or the client 
object model without any additional handling. 

If you want to add an object type to both the server-side schema and the 
client object model, you can add the object type to the object model, and 
use :ref:`Development Mode <development-mode>` to let App Services handle the 
server-side schema updates. Or you can manually add the object type to both 
the model and the schema.

.. note:: These changes may trigger a resync

   When you add a new object type, we retrieve the documents for the 
   collection and re-insert them into App Services to get the new values. This
   is expected behavior, but it does cause a temporary halt to propagating 
   changes while this process is underway.

.. _schema-update-add-a-default-value:

Add a Default Value on a Property
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can add a default value on an object's required property. When you 
insert an Atlas document missing this required property into the 
collection, the Device SDK clients set the property to the default value. However, 
the same property on the Atlas document remains empty until a client makes 
changes to the property or updates the document directly in Atlas.

For more information on how default values are helpful when modifying 
existing Atlas documents, see :ref:`<schema-update-add-required-property>`.

.. warning:: Ensure the default value type and property's type are the same

   The default field does not have type validation. If the default field's type
   and the property's type are not the same, the error will indicate that
   the document is missing a required field. 

.. _schema-update-add-required-property:

Add a Required Property
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can add a required property to the client's object model, and 
use :ref:`Development Mode <development-mode>` to let App Services infer the 
server-side schema updates. Or you can manually add the 
required property to both the client model and the Atlas schema. 
However, you should consider making the property optional to avoid the need to 
modify existing Atlas documents. 

.. note:: Required Properties Missing in a Schema Subset Will Default to Zero

   Clients can open the Realm with a schema subset that doesn't 
   include a required property. The server populates the 
   missing required value field with a zero or blank value
   (like 0, "", or 0.0 depending on the property type) when the document syncs.

Modify Existing Atlas Documents
```````````````````````````````

When you add a new required property, you must update existing documents with 
the new property or they do not sync to the client. This may give client 
users the impression that the data has been lost. Resolve this issue by
adding the new property to each impacted document and populating it with a 
value. After you update the documents to match the client schema, they 
sync to the client application.

When you add a new required property, App Services retrieves the documents for 
the collection that have new values per the updated schema. App Services iterates 
through those documents and re-inserts them to get the new values. This is
expected behavior, but it does cause a temporary halt to propagating changes 
while this process is underway.

.. important::

   App Services uses a ``__realm_sync.unsynced_documents`` collection to track 
   unsynced documents. When you add a required property, the re-sync process can 
   push this collection over the limit of 100,000 documents. In this case, you must 
   :ref:`terminate and re-enable sync <terminating-realm-sync>`, even though the 
   change you're making is a non-breaking change. 

.. _schema-update-add-optional-property:

Add an Optional Property
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to add an optional property to both the server-side schema and 
the client object model, you can add the optional property to the object 
model, and use :ref:`Development Mode <development-mode>` to let 
App Services infer the server-side schema updates. Or you can manually add the 
optional property to both the model and the schema.

.. note:: These changes may trigger a resync

   When you add a new optional property, we retrieve the documents for the 
   collection that have new values per the updated schema. We iterate 
   through those documents and re-insert them into App Services to get 
   the new values. This is expected behavior, but it does cause a temporary 
   halt to propagating changes while this process is underway.

.. _schema-update-remove-object-type:

Remove an Object Type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can remove an object from the client's object model as a non-breaking change. 
If you remove the object from the server-side schema, it is a breaking change.
For this reason, we recommend you remove the object type from the client-side 
object model only and leave it in place on the server-side schema. 

.. _schema-update-remove-property:

Remove a Property
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can remove an optional or required property from the client-side object model and 
leave it in place on the server-side schema. This is a 
non-breaking change to the object model.

If you remove a property from the server-side schema, it is a breaking change. 
For this reason, we recommend that you remove the property from the client-side 
object model only and leave it in place on the server-side schema. 

To maintain backward compatibility, removing a property from a client-side 
object model does not delete the property from the database. Instead, 
new objects retain the removed property, and App Services sets the value to an 
appropriate empty value, such as ``null`` for nullable properties, a 0 for 
integer values, or an empty string for string values. 

.. _schema-update-change-object-type-name:

Rename an Object Type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Changing an object's name on both the server-side schema and the client-side 
object model is a breaking change. However, some SDKs offer an API to 
map a new object name to an existing name in the schema. This allows you to 
rename an object on the client but not change the object name on the server. 
In this way, you avoid triggering a migration. Object name 
mapping is supported in the following SDKs:

- :ref:`Flutter SDK - Remap a Class <flutter-map-property>`
- :ref:`Java SDK - Rename a Class <java-rename-field>`
- :ref:`Kotlin SDK - Remap a Class <kotlin-remap-a-property>`
- :ref:`.NET SDK - Rename a Class <dotnet-rename-property>`
- :ref:`Node.js SDK - Remap a PClass <node-remap-a-property>`

.. TODO: Add RN once docs are updated in DOCSP-32466 
.. :ref:`React Native SDK - Remap a Property <react-native-remap-a-property>`

If name mapping is not an option, consider implementing a  
:ref:`partner collection strategy <schema-partner_collection-strategy>`, in which 
you keep the existing collection and schema, and create a new collection 
with the new schema. 

If you choose to change the object's name instead of using the partner collection 
strategy, you must terminate sync, manually update the schema, 
and re-enable sync. In addition, your client 
application must perform a :ref:`client reset <client-resets>` to restore Sync.
In the default client reset mode, the client attempts to recover any 
unsynced changes before resetting.

.. note::

   :ref:`Development Mode <development-mode>` 
   does not automatically update your schema for these changes. 

.. _schema-update-change-property-name:

Rename a Property
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Changing a property's name on both the server-side schema and the client-side 
object model is a breaking change. However, some SDKs offer an API to 
map a new property name to an existing name in the schema. This allows you to 
rename a property on the client but not change the property name on the server. 
In this way, you avoid triggering a migration. Property name 
mapping is supported in the following SDKs:

- :ref:`Flutter SDK - Remap a Property <flutter-map-property>`
- :ref:`Java SDK - Rename a Field <java-rename-field>`
- :ref:`Kotlin SDK - Remap a Property <kotlin-remap-a-property>`
- :ref:`.NET SDK - Rename a Property <dotnet-rename-property>`
- :ref:`Node.js SDK - Remap a Property <node-remap-a-property>`
- :ref:`React Native SDK - Remap a Property <react-native-remap-a-property>`
- :ref:`Swift SDK - Remap a Property <swift-rename-property>`

.. warning:: Update existing documents

   If you rename a property in the server-side schema, you must 
   update existing documents with that new property name or they do not sync 
   to the client. This may give client users the impression that the data 
   has been lost.

If name mapping is not an option, consider implementing a  
partner collection strategy, in which 
you keep the existing collection and schema, and create a new collection 
with the new schema. This strategy is described in the :ref:`schema-partner_collection-strategy` section on this page.

If you choose to change the property's name, you must terminate sync, manually update the schema, 
and re-enable sync. In addition, your client 
application must perform a :ref:`client reset <client-resets>` to restore Sync.
In the default client reset mode, the client attempts to recover any 
unsynced changes before resetting.

When you terminate and re-enable sync, you must also update existing Atlas 
documents to enable them to Sync with your client applications. 
Without this additional handling, those documents do not Sync and it may 
appear in the client that the data has been lost. You could resolve this issue 
in two ways:

- Change the old field name on each document to match the new schema
- Add a new field to each document with a name that matches the new schema, 
  and copy the value from the old field into it

After you've made these changes, the appropriate documents sync to the client 
application.

.. _schema-update-change-property-type-but-keep-name:

Change a Property Type but Keep the Name
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Changing a property's type is a breaking change to both the server-side 
schema and the client-side object model.

.. warning:: Update existing documents

   If you change a property's type in the server-side schema, you must 
   update existing documents with that new property type or they do not sync 
   to the client. This may give client users the impression that the data 
   has been lost.

Instead of changing a property's type, consider implementing the 
partner collection strategy, in which 
you keep the existing collection and schema, and create a new collection 
with the new schema. This strategy is described in the :ref:`schema-partner_collection-strategy` section on this page.

If you choose to change the property's type instead of using the partner collection 
strategy, you must terminate sync, manually update the schema, 
and re-enable sync. In addition, your client 
application must perform a :ref:`client reset <client-resets>` to restore Sync.
In the default client reset mode, the client attempts to recover any 
unsynced changes before resetting.

.. note::

   :ref:`Development Mode <development-mode>` 
   does not automatically update your schema for these changes. 

When you terminate and re-enable sync, you must also update existing Atlas 
documents to enable them to Sync with your client applications. 
Without this additional handling, those documents do not Sync and it may 
appear in the client that the data has been lost. You could resolve this issue 
in two ways:

- Change the old field type on each document to match the new schema
- Add a new field to each document with the type that matches the new schema, 
  and copy the value from the old field into it, transforming its type

After you've made these changes, the appropriate documents should once again 
sync to the client application.

.. _schema-update-change-property-status:

Change a Property's Status Between Optional and Required
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Changing a property's status between optional and required 
is a breaking change to both the server-side schema and the client-side object model.

.. warning:: Update existing documents

   If you change a property's status in the server-side schema, you must 
   update existing documents with that new property type or they do not sync 
   to the client. This may give client users the impression that the data 
   has been lost.

Instead of changing a property's status, consider implementing the 
:ref:`partner collection strategy <schema-partner_collection-strategy>`, in which 
you keep the existing collection and schema, and create a new collection 
with the new schema. 

If you choose to change the property's status instead of using the partner collection 
strategy, you must terminate sync, manually update the schema, 
and re-enable sync. In addition, your client 
application must perform a :ref:`client reset <client-resets>` to restore Sync.
In the default client reset mode, the client attempts to recover any 
unsynced changes before resetting.

.. _schema-partner_collection-strategy:

Partner Collections Strategy
----------------------------

When you need to make a breaking schema change, you can use the partner
collection strategy to ensure that data flows in both directions.

A **partner collection** is a collection that contains the same data as
the original collection, but has the new schema definition in place. Partner
collections use database triggers to ensure that data flows in both directions,
meaning that when one collection is written to, the other is also written to 
(with the data modifications required for the new schema).

Example
~~~~~~~

The following demonstrates how to implement a breaking schema change using the
partner collection strategy for an updated ``Task`` collection schema. 

The JSON schema below is the initial collection. Note the ``_id`` field of type ``objectId``:

.. code-block:: json
    :caption: Initial Task Schema
    :emphasize-lines: 9-10

    {
        "title": "Task",
        "bsonType": "object",
        "required": [
            "_id",
            "name"
        ],
        "properties": {
            "_id": {
                "bsonType": "objectId"
            },
            "_partition": {
                "bsonType": "string"
            },
            "name": {
                "bsonType": "string"
            }
        }
    }

The *new* schema is the same, except we want the ``_id`` field to be a string:

.. code-block:: json
    :caption: New Task Schema 
    :emphasize-lines: 9-10

    {
        "title": "Task",
        "bsonType": "object",
        "required": [
            "_id",
            "name"
        ],
        "properties": {
            "_id": {
                "bsonType": "string"
            },
            "_partition": {
                "bsonType": "string"
            },
            "name": {
                "bsonType": "string"
            }
        }
    }

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Initialize Partner Collection with an Aggregation Pipeline

      Since breaking changes cannot be performed directly on a synced object
      schema, you must create a partner collection with a schema containing the
      required changes. You must ensure that the partner collection has the same
      data as the original collection so that newer clients can synchronize with
      older clients.

      The recommended approach to copying the data from your original collection to
      the new partner collection is to use the :manual:`Aggregation Framework
      </aggregation/>`.

      You can create and run an aggregation pipeline from the 
      `mongo shell <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-shell/>`__,
      by using the :compass:`</aggregation-pipeline-builder/>`, or with the
      :atlas:`</data-explorer/cloud-agg-pipeline/>`.

      The pipeline will have the following stages:

      1. Match all the documents in the initial collection by passing
         an empty filter to the :manual:`$match operator
         </reference/operator/aggregation/match/>`.

      2. Modify the fields of the initial collection by using an
         :manual:`aggregation pipeline operator </reference/operator/aggregation/>`. In
         the following example, the data is transformed using the :manual:`$addFields
         operator </reference/operator/aggregation/addFields/>`. The ``_id`` field is
         transformed to a ``string`` type with the :manual:`$toString operator
         </reference/operator/aggregation/toString/>`.

      3. Write the transformed data to the partner collection by using the
         :manual:`$out operator </reference/operator/aggregation/out/>` and specifying
         the partner collection name. In this example, we wrote the data to a new
         collection named ``TaskV2``.

      Here the same pipeline as represented in the Atlas and Compass UIs. Note that
      both of these tools provide a preview of the changes; in this case, the
      conversion the ``_id`` field from an ObjectId to a string:

      .. figure:: /images/agg-in-atlas.png
         :alt: Atlas UI for Aggregation Builder

      The following example shows the complete aggregation pipeline as it would
      look if you used :mongosh:`mongosh </>` to do the conversion:

      .. code-block:: shell
         :caption: Match All Documents in the Initial Collection and Output Them to the Partner Collection

         use "<database-name>" // switch the current db to the db that the Task collection is stored in
         collection = db.Task;
         collection.aggregate([
           { $match: {} }, // match all documents in the Task collection
           {
             $addFields: { // transform the data
               _id: { $toString: "$_id" }, // change the _id field of the data to a string type
             },
           },
           { $out: "TaskV2" }, // output the data to a partner collection, TaskV2
         ]);

   .. step:: Set up Database Triggers for Partner Collection

      Once your partner collection is set up, you can use it to read existing data.
      However, any new writes to the data of *either collection* will not be
      in the other collection. This causes the old clients to be out of sync with the
      new clients.

      To ensure that data is reflected in both collections, you set up a
      :ref:`database trigger <create-a-database-trigger>` on each collection. When
      data is written to one collection, the trigger's function performs the write
      to the partner collection.

      Follow the steps in the :ref:`database trigger <create-a-database-trigger>`
      documentation to create a trigger that copies data from the ``Task`` collection to
      the ``TaskV2`` collection for all operation types. Repeat these steps to create
      a second trigger that copies data from the ``TaskV2`` collection to the
      ``Task`` collection. 

   .. step:: Add Trigger Functions

      Triggers require backing functions that run when the trigger fires. In this
      case, we need to create two functions: a forward-migration function and a
      reverse-migration function.

      The forward migration trigger listens for inserts, updates, and deletes in the
      Task collection, modifies them to reflect the TaskV2 collection's schema, and
      then applies them to the TaskV2 collection.

      To listen for changes to the TaskV2 collection and apply them to the Task
      collection, write a reverse-migration function for the TaskV2 collection's
      trigger. The reverse migration follows the same idea as the previous step.

      In the forward-migration function, we check which operation has triggered the
      function: if the operation type is ``Delete`` (meaning a document
      has been deleted in the Task collection), the document is also deleted in the
      TaskV2 collection. If the operation type is a ``Write`` (inserted or modified)
      event, an aggregation pipeline is created. In the pipeline, the inserted or
      modified document in the Task collection is extracted using the
      :manual:`$match operator </reference/operator/aggregation/match/>`. The
      extracted document is then transformed to adhere to the
      ``TaskV2`` collection's schema. Finally, the transformed data is written to the
      ``TaskV2`` collection by using the
      :manual:`$merge operator </reference/operator/aggregation/merge/>`:

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/functions/copyTaskObjectToTaskV2.codeblock.copyTaskObject.js
         :language: javascript
         :caption: copyTaskObjectToTaskV2 function

      The reverse-migration function goes through similar steps as the example in the
      prior step. If a document has been deleted in one collection, the document is
      also deleted in the other collection. If the operation type is a write event,
      the changed document from ``TaskV2`` is extracted, transformed to match the
      Task collection's schema, and written into the ``Task`` collection:

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/functions/copyTaskV2ObjectToTask.codeblock.copyTaskV2Object.js
         :language: javascript
         :caption: copyTaskV2ObjectToTask function
