Overview
--------

In modern applications, users expect their data to be accurate no matter
which device or browser they connect from. Data modeling ensures the
accuracy of application data by performing type and format checks on
fields. 

Atlas App Services allows you to define, synchronize, and enforce your data
model in two formats: 

- A server-side :ref:`BSON schema <schemas>`, which defines your
  data as MongoDB documents to enforce validation and synchronization
  in the cloud.

- A Realm data model, which defines your data as native objects in your mobile application.

Having these two forms of data models allows your data to be consistent
and :doc:`synced </sync>` regardless of which clients
write the data.

.. _object-schema:

Object Schema
-------------

An **object schema** defines the properties and relationships of a Realm
object. Object schemas are defined using JSON schema in the
:guilabel:`Schema` sidebar entry of the App Services UI:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "title": "Dog",
     "bsonType": "object",
     "required": [
       "_id",
       "_partition",
       "name"
     ],
     "properties": {
       "_id": {
         "bsonType": "objectId"
       },
       "_partition": {
         "bsonType": "string"
       },
       "name": {
         "bsonType": "string"
       },
       "age": {
         "bsonType": "int"
       }
       "breed": {
         "bsonType": "string"
       }
     }
   }

.. _sync-type-name:

Type Name
~~~~~~~~~

The ``title`` field contains the name of the object type represented by
the schema. This is equivalent to a class or schema name in a Realm SDK.
The type name should be unique among all schemas in your synced cluster
but is otherwise arbitrary and does not need to match the collection
name.

A conventional approach is to name each object type with a singular
noun, like "Dog" or "Person". Schemas generated in development mode or
by sampling existing documents use this convention.

.. _property-schema:

Property Schema
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A **property schema** is a field-level configuration that defines and
constrains a specific property in an object schema. Every object schema
must include a property schema for each property in the object. At
minimum, a property schema defines a property's data type and indicates
whether the property is required.

You can configure the following constraints for a given property:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 20 60

   * - Parameter
     - Type
     - Description

   * - Type
     - String
     - Every property in a Realm object has a strongly defined data
       type. A property's type can be a primitive data type or an object
       type defined in the same {+realm+}. The type also specifies whether
       the property contains a single value or a list of values.

       {+client-database+} supports the following property types:

       - boolean
       - integer
       - double
       - string
       - date
       - decimal128
       - objectId
       - uuid
       - mixed
       - array
       - object

       .. seealso::

          For more information on supported data types, see the
          documentation on :ref:`Schema Types <schema-types>`.

   * - Optional
     - Boolean
     - Optional properties may contain a null value or be entirely
       omitted from an object. By default, all properties are optional 
       unless explicitly marked as required.

   * - Default
     - Boolean
     - If a client application creates a new object that does not have a
       value for a defined property, the object uses the default value
       instead.

       When you attempt to create an object that is missing a value
       for a required field, it fails validation and does not persist
       to the {+realm+}.

   * - Indexed
     - Boolean
     - A property index significantly increases the speed of certain
       read operations at the cost of additional overhead for write
       operations. Indexes are particularly useful for equality
       comparison, such as querying for an object based on the value of
       a property. However, indexes consume additional storage.


.. tip:: Partition field

   When using :ref:`Partition-Based Sync <partition-based-sync>`, your
   object schema should include the :ref:`partition key <partition-key>`
   as defined in your sync configuration.
   
   When using :ref:`Flexible Sync <flexible-sync>`, your schema does not
   need a partition key.

Summary
-------
- App Services uses two different data models: a {+frontend-schema+} for 
  mobile and an App Services Schema for Atlas. Changes to one data model match
  the other data model. 
- If you already have data in Atlas, App Services creates an App Services Schema 
  by sampling that data. That App Services Schema can be translated into a Realm 
  Object Model to be used in your App Services mobile application code. 
- If you do not have data in Atlas or are developing with a mobile-first 
  approach, you can turn on :guilabel:`Development Mode` to allow for data 
  model changes from an App Services mobile client. When you finish developing your 
  {+frontend-schema+}, you can turn off :guilabel:`Development Mode`, and 
  your App Services Schema will be auto-updated with your updated data model 
  configuration. Atlas will begin using this updated data model configuration 
  for data validation on your cluster immediately.
