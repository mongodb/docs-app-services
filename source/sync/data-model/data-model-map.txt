Overview
--------

This page contains information on how the App Services Schema used by
Atlas Device Sync maps to the Realm Object Schema used by the Realm SDKs.

To generate Realm SDK Schemas from your App Services Schemas,
refer to :ref:`Generate SDK Object Models <generate-sdk-object-models>`.
To generate App Services Schemas from Realm SDK client code,
refer to :ref:`Development Mode <development-mode>`.

To learn more about how Device Sync uses these two schemas,
refer to the :ref:`Sync Data Model Overview <sync-schema-overview>`.

.. _database-and-collection-name-mapping:

Databases, Collections, and Objects
-----------------------------------

When you configure Device Sync, you :ref:`specify the data source 
<sync-config-data-source>` where you want to store data. This data source 
may contain multiple databases, and each database may contain multiple 
collections.

The :ref:`App Services schema <schemas>` maps your Realm Database object 
names to collections in databases in your Device Sync data source. The 
``title`` field in an App Services schema maps to the object type name in 
Realm Database. Because the ``title`` name determines the mapping between 
client objects and the appropriate Atlas collection, this name must be
unique among all schemas in your synced data source.

The ``title`` does not need to match the collection name. 

.. example::

   Consider an app with a database named ``Pets``. It may contain multiple 
   collections, such as ``Canine`` and ``Feline``. The App Services schema
   for the ``Canine`` collection might resemble :ref:`the example below 
   <sync-app-services-schema-dog-example>`, where the ``title`` field of 
   the schema is ``Dog``. That would map a Realm Database object called 
   ``Dog`` to the ``Canine`` collection in the ``Pets`` database.

   You could not have another schema whose ``title`` was ``Dog`` in the 
   same cluster. For example, you could not sync an object with a ``title`` 
   of ``Dog`` to both a ``Debug`` and a ``Test`` database in the 
   same cluster. If you want to sync the same object to different 
   collections for app development purposes, you must use different 
   data sources - one cluster for development and a different cluster
   for production.

.. _map-realm-to-atlas-with-development-mode:

Mapping with Development Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you :ref:`enable Development Mode <enable-development-mode>` in your 
Device Sync configuration, App Services can automatically create collections 
and schemas for Realm Database objects that you sync. It creates those 
collections in the :ref:`database you specify 
<sync-config-database-name>` when you enable Development Mode.

With Development Mode enabled, Sync looks for a collection whose App Services 
schema has a ``title`` that matches the name of your Realm Database object 
type. This collection could be in any database in your linked data source. 
It doesn't have to be in the database you add when you configure 
Development Mode.

If there is no corresponding ``title`` in any App Services schema in your 
linked data source, App Services creates a new collection for this object 
type. This collection is created in the database you specify when you enable 
Development Mode. The collection name matches the object's type, and the 
corresponding App Services schema has a ``title`` field whose value is the 
name of the object type. This creates the mapping between your Realm 
Database object and the new collection.

.. example::

   Consider an Atlas cluster with a database named ``Pets``. It contains a 
   ``Feline`` collection with existing data. 
   
   In your application code, you define a new ``Dog`` object. You enable
   Development Mode, and specify the ``Pets`` database as the database 
   in which to create collections for new object types. When you sync your
   new ``Dog`` object, App Services creates a ``Dog`` collection in the 
   ``Pets`` database and creates a schema for it. The ``title`` of the 
   object in the schema is ``Dog``.

   If you later add a new ``Person`` object to your application code and 
   then sync it, App Services creates a new collection for this 
   ``Person`` object in the ``Pets`` database. If you wanted to create a 
   collection for the ``Person`` object in a different database, you 
   could :ref:`define a schema <enforce-a-schema>` for the ``Person`` object
   in a different database. Or you could disable and re-enable Development 
   Mode, and select a different database in which to create new collections.

Mappings
--------

.. _sync-type-name:

Type Name
~~~~~~~~~

The ``title`` field contains the name of the object type represented by
the schema. This is equivalent to a class or schema name in a Realm SDK.
The type name must be unique among all schemas in your synced cluster
but is otherwise arbitrary and does not need to match the collection
name.

A conventional approach is to name each object type with a singular
noun, like "Dog" or "Person". Schemas generated in development mode or
by sampling existing documents use this convention.

.. note:: 

   To work with Atlas Device Sync, type names cannot exceed {+name-char-limit+} UTF-8 characters.

Property Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can configure the following constraints for a given property:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 20 60

   * - Parameter
     - Type
     - Description

   * - Type
     - String
     - Every property in a Realm Object Schema has a strongly defined data
       type. A property's type can be a primitive data type or an object
       type defined in the same Realm Object Schema. The type also specifies whether
       the property contains a single value or a list of values.

       Realm Database supports the following property types:

       - boolean
       - integer
       - double
       - string
       - date
       - decimal128
       - objectId
       - uuid
       - mixed
       - array
       - object

       For more information on supported data types, refer to :ref:`Schema Types <schema-types>`.

   * - Optional
     - Boolean
     - Optional properties may contain a null value or be entirely
       omitted from an object. By default, all properties are optional
       unless explicitly marked as required.

   * - Default
     - Boolean
     - If a client application creates a new object that does not have a
       value for a defined property, the object uses the default value
       instead.

       If you open a Realm in the client with a schema subset that doesn't 
       include a required property, the server will automatically
       populate the value of the required property with a zero or blank
       default value.

       When you attempt to create an object that is missing a value
       for a required field, it fails validation and does not persist
       to the realm.

   * - Indexed
     - Boolean
     - A property index significantly increases the speed of certain
       read operations at the cost of additional overhead for write
       operations. Indexes are particularly useful for equality
       comparison, such as querying for an object based on the value of
       a property. However, indexes consume additional storage.

Array Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Both Realm Object Schemas and App Services Schemas support array properties.

You can find information on using array data types in the Realm SDK documentation
on defining a Realm Object Schema.

- :ref:`cpp-supported-property-types`
- :ref:`Dart Types - Flutter SDK <flutter-dart-types>`
- :ref:`Lists - Java SDK <java-field-relationships-lists>`

- :ref:`Supported Property Types - Node.js SDK <node-supported-property-types>`
- :ref:`Supported Property Types - React Native SDK <react-native-supported-property-types>`
- :ref:`swift-supported-types`

For more information on modeling array properties in an App Services Schema,
refer to :ref:`BSON Types - Array <schema-type-array>`.
App Services Schemas support certain constraints that Realm Object Schemas do not,
such as specifying the minimum and maximum number of items.

Embedded Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Embedded objects are embedded as nested data inside of a parent object.
An embedded object inherits the lifecycle of its parent object.
It cannot exist as an independent Realm object.

Realm SDK embedded object documentation:

- :ref:`Define an Embedded Object - C++ SDK <cpp-embedded-object>`
- :ref:`Embedded Objects - Flutter SDK <flutter-embedded-objects>`
- :ref:`Define an Embedded Object Field - Java SDK <java-define-an-embedded-object-property>`
- :ref:`Embedded Objects - Kotlin SDK <kotlin-embedded-objects>`
- :ref:`dotnet-embedded-objects`
- :ref:`Embedded Objects - Node.js SDK <node-embedded-objects>`
- :ref:`Embedded Objects - React Native SDK <react-native-embedded-objects>`
- :ref:`Define an Embedded Object Property - Swift SDK <ios-embedded-objects>`

For more information on modeling to-one relationships in an App Services Schema,
refer to :ref:`Embedded Object Relationships <relationships-embedded-object>`.

Sets
~~~~

Realm Object Schemas and App Services Schemas both support the Set data type.
A set is a collection of unique values.

Realm SDK Set documentation:

- :ref:`C++ SDK: Set <cpp-set-collections>`
- :ref:`RealmSet - Flutter SDK <flutter-realm-set>`
- :ref:`java-realmset`
- :ref:`RealmSet - Kotlin SDK <kotlin-realm-set>`
- :ref:`dotnet-client-sets`
- :ref:`node-data-types-sets`
- :ref:`react-native-data-types-sets`
- :ref:`Mutable Set - Swift SDK <ios-mutableset-data-type>`


For more information on modeling sets in an App Services Schema,
refer to :ref:`Set <schema-type-set>`.

Dictionaries
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Realm Object Schemas and App Services Schemas both support the Dictionary data type.
A set is a collection of unique values.
A dictionary is a collection of dynamic and unique string keys paired with values of a given type.
A dictionary is functionally an object or document without pre-defined field names.

Realm SDK dictionary documentation:

- :ref:`Map/Dictionary - C++ SDK <cpp-map>`
- The Realm Flutter SDK does not support Dictionaries yet
- :ref:`java-realmdictionary`
- :ref:`Realm Dictionary - Kotlin SDK <kotlin-define-realm-dictionary-type>`
- :ref:`dotnet-client-dictionaries`
- :ref:`node-data-types-dictionaries`
- :ref:`react-native-data-types-dictionaries`
- :ref:`Map/Dictionary - Swift SDK <ios-map>`

For more information on modeling dictionaries in an App Services Schema,
refer to :ref:`Dictionary <schema-type-dictionary>`.

Relationships
-------------

Realm Object Schemas support the following types of relationships:

- To-one relationships: A to-one relationship means that an object is related
  in a specific way to no more than one other object.
- To-many relationships: A to-many relationship means that an object is related
  in a specific way to multiple objects.
- Inverse relationships: An inverse relationship links an object back
  to any other objects that refer to it in a defined to-one or to-many relationship.

App Services Schemas support to-one and to-many relationships.
App Services Schemas *do not* support inverse relationships.

Realm SDK relationship documentation:

- :ref:`cpp-relationships`
- :ref:`Define Relationship Properties - Flutter SDK <flutter-client-relationships>`
- :ref:`kotlin-relationships`
- :ref:`Define a Relationship Field - Java SDK <java-relationships>`
- :ref:`dotnet-client-relationships`
- :ref:`Define Relationship Properties - Node.js SDK <node-define-relationship-properties>`
- :ref:`Define Relationship Properties - React Native SDK <react-native-relationships>`
- :ref:`swift-model-relationships`

For more information on modeling relationships in an App Services Schema,
refer to :ref:`Relationships <relationships>`.

Example
-------

This example shows how to model a ``Dog`` with Device Sync.

.. _sync-app-services-schema-dog-example:

App Services Schema
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This App Services Schema creates the ``Dog`` data model used by Device Sync.

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "title": "Dog",
     "bsonType": "object",
     "required": [
       "_id",
       "_partition",
       "name"
     ],
     "properties": {
       "_id": {
         "bsonType": "objectId"
       },
       "_partition": {
         "bsonType": "string"
       },
       "name": {
         "bsonType": "string"
       },
       "age": {
         "bsonType": "int"
       }
       "breed": {
         "bsonType": "string"
       }
     }
   }

Realm Object Schema
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following code examples create the ``Dog`` Realm Object Schema in each of the
Realm SDKs.

Data in Atlas
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An application using Device Sync for the ``Dog`` data model creates MongoDB documents
in Atlas that looks like the following example.

.. code-block:: js

   {
     "_id": ObjectId('616f44305a205add93ff1081'),
     "age": 8,
     "breed": "Golden Retriever",
     "name": "Jasper"
   }
