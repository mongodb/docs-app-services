Overview
--------

Atlas App Services can automatically translate your server-side document schemas to a Realm Object Schema that will
work with your SDK of choice. You can generate the object models using either the App Services UI or CLI.

Procedure
---------

.. tabs-realm-admin-interfaces::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: ui
      
      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Navigate to the SDKs Screen

            To begin, navigate to the
            :guilabel:`SDKs` screen under the :guilabel:`Build` section in the {+leftnav+}.
            Here you will find the tools to make your app compatible with different SDKs.


         .. step:: Select the Data Models Tab

            From the :guilabel:`Data Models` tab, you can view the generated object models for your
            SDK.


         .. step:: Select Your Data Model Language

            Under :guilabel:`Data Models`, choose which language you are using for development.
            The page contains a generated version of each of your object types translated to the
            language you choose. You can view the translated version of each of your data
            schemas by clicking the approproate dropdown.

         .. step:: Copy the Data Models

            Click on the Copy All Data Models button, to bring the object models into your own
            code. Decide whether you want to include the import statements (the default is to
            include them) and click on copy. You are now ready to paste these generated object models
            into your own code.

         .. step:: Generate Data Models Based On Your Schema

            To begin generating the data object models for your app, run the following:

            .. code-block:: shell

               realm-cli schema datamodels -a "<Your App ID>"


         .. step:: Confirm Options for Generating Data Models

            You will be prompted for the following details:

            .. code-block::

               ? Select the language you would like to generate data models in
               ? Would you like to omit imports?
               ? Would you like group all generated data models together?

            1. Select from the list of available languages which language you would like
               your object models to be in

            #. Choose whether you'd like to omit import statements from your data models

            #. Choose whether you'd like the data model for each schema to be
               grouped together in the output


         .. step:: Use Your Data Model

            Copy and paste the object models from your terminal into your code.
