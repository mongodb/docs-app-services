Overview
--------

You can create a schema for your App in one of two ways:

- :ref:`Create an App Services Schema from a Realm Object Schema <create-schema-from-rom>`:
  Alternatively, if you are developing mobile-first and do not already have
  data in your Atlas cluster, you can translate your Realm Object Schema into
  a schema for use with Atlas. Regardless of the approach that you take,
  when you configure both your Atlas cluster and Mobile application to use
  the respective data model, changes to the data model between the server
  and client are auto-updated.
- :ref:`Create a Realm Object Schema from an Atlas App Services Schema <create-rom-from-schema>`: 
  If you have data in your 
  `MongoDB Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/realm?tck=docs_realm#atlas-form-container>`_ 
  cluster already, MongoDB generates a schema by sampling your data.
  Atlas App Services can then translate that schema into a Realm Object Schema
  to use in your mobile application with the Realm SDK.

Create an App Services Schema from a Realm Object Model
-------------------------------------------------------

.. note:: Link a MongoDB Atlas Data Source
   
   Your App must have at least one :ref:`linked data source
   <data-sources>` in order to create a schema.
   
   You cannot use Device Sync with a :ref:`serverless instance
   <serverless-caveats>` or :ref:`{+adf-instance+} <data-federation-caveats>`.

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Enable Development Mode Sync

      First,  :ref:`enable Development Mode <development-mode>`.

      You can alter or define a Realm Object Schema through your mobile client SDK.
      Changes to your Realm Object Schema are only allowed when
      :guilabel:`Development Mode` is on in the App Services UI. App Services will
      reflect these changes to your Realm Object Schema in your App Services Schema used for
      Atlas. To enable Development Mode, click the slider to the right of 
      :guilabel:`Development Mode`.

         :alt: The UI to enable Development Mode
         :lightbox:


   .. step:: Edit Your Realm Object Schema

      As you continue to develop your application, you will need to modify
      your data model with it to enforce different data validation rules
      based on those changes. While :guilabel:`Development Mode` is on, you
      can edit your Realm Object Schema in your client code. Data Validation
      occurs when :guilabel:`Development Mode` is off, so App Services does
      not accept changes to your Realm Object Schema while
      :guilabel:`Development Mode` is not on.

      .. important:: Primary Key _id Required

         To work with Atlas Device Sync, your data model **must** have a primary key field
         called ``_id``. ``_id`` can be of type ``string``, ``int``, or
         ``objectId``.

      .. example::

         A group is developing a social media application. When the group
         first developed their application, a user's birthday was a required
         field of the User's data model. However, due to privacy concerns
         over the amount of user data that is stored, management creates a
         new requirement to make the user's birthday field an optional
         field. Application developers turn on :guilabel:`Development Mode`
         in the App Services UI and then edit their user model within
         their client code.

         .. code-block:: javascript

           const realmObjectModel = {
             name: 'User',
             properties: {
               _id: 'objectId',
               _partition: 'string',
               name: 'string',
               // developers set optional: true to adhere to the new requirement
               birthday: {type: 'date', optional: true},
             },
             primaryKey: '_id'
           };

           Realm.open({schema: realmObjectModel, sync: {/*...*/}})
             .then(realm => {
               // ... use the realm instance to read and modify data
             })

      Refer to the Realm SDK-specific documentation for creating Realm Object Schemas.

      - :ref:`Realm Swift SDK <swift-object-models>`

   .. step:: Update Your App Services Schema with the Realm Object Schema Changes

      While :guilabel:`Development Mode` is on, App Services doesn't validate
      writes against your data model, allowing you to freely update your Realm
      Object Model. When you turn off :guilabel:`Development Mode`, MongoDB
      App Services automatically updates your App Services Schema and starts to 
      enforce data validation for your Atlas cluster based on it.

      In the :guilabel:`Sync` screen, turn off :guilabel:`Development Mode` by 
      clicking the slider next to :guilabel:`Development Mode`. The UI indicates 
      that Development Mode has been turned off.

      .. note::

        To make future data model updates from your mobile client code, you
        can follow this procedure again.

.. _create-rom-from-schema:

Create a Realm Object Schema from an App Services Schema
--------------------------------------------------------

.. note:: Link a MongoDB Atlas Data Source
   
   Your app must have at least one :ref:`linked data source
   <data-sources>` in order to define an App Services data model.
   
   You cannot use sync with a :ref:`serverless instance
   <serverless-caveats>` or :ref:`{+adf-instance+} <data-federation-caveats>`.

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Define an App Services Schema

      To get started, ensure you have an App Services Schema defined. App Services
      will translate this App Services Schema into a Realm Object Schema to be
      configured and utilized in your mobile application.

      .. important:: Primary Key _id Required

         To work with Atlas Device Sync, your data model **must** have a primary key field
         called ``_id``. ``_id`` can be of type ``string``, ``int``, ``uuid``, ``ObjectId``, or
         ``objectId``.
      
      .. important:: 

         To work with Atlas Device Sync, your schema object :ref:`type names <sync-type-name>` 
         cannot exceed {+name-char-limit+} UTF-8 characters.

      .. note::

         To learn how to define a schema for a collection in the synced cluster, see
         :ref:`enforce-a-schema`.


   .. step:: View the Realm Object Schema

      The Realm Object Schema defines and validates your data in your mobile
      client application. To view your Realm Object Schema, navigate to the
      :guilabel:`Realm SDKs` page and then click the :guilabel:`Realm Object Models` 
      tab. On this page, you can view your App Services Schema as a
      generated Realm Object Schema in your language of choice.

         :alt: The generated Realm Object Models and associated warnings in the UI
         :width: 750px
         :lightbox:

   
   .. step:: Open a Realm with the Realm Object Schema

      You can use the generated Realm Object Schema in your
      client application. In order to begin enforcing data validation with
      your data model, you can open a realm with the Realm Object Schema.
      This will prevent improper data from entering your database from your
      mobile client. Click :guilabel:`Copy` on the right-hand side of the
      Realm Object Schema for the Object Model you want to integrate into
      your mobile application code. This will copy the Realm Object Schema
      code for the SDK of your choice into your clipboard. Open your mobile
      application code in your IDE and paste the Realm Object Schema code in.

              const UserSchema = { // your copied and pasted Realm Object Schema
                name: 'User',
                properties: {
                  _id: 'objectId',
                  _partition: 'string',
                  name: 'string',
                  birthday: 'date'
                },
                primaryKey: '_id'
              };
              // Initialize a realm with your Realm Object Schema
              Realm.open({schema: UserSchema, sync: { /* ... */ }})
                .then(realm => {
                  // ... use the realm instance to read and modify data
                })
