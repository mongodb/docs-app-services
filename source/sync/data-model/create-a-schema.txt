Overview
--------

You can create a schema for your {+app+} in one of two ways:

- :ref:`Create a {+frontend-schema+} from an {+service-short+} Schema <create-rom-from-schema>`: 
  If you have data in your 
  `{+atlas+} <https://www.mongodb.com/realm?tck=docs_realm#atlas-form-container>`_ 
  cluster already, MongoDB generates an {+service-short+} Schema by sampling your data. 
  {+service+} can then translate that {+service-short+} Schema into a {+frontend-schema+} 
  to use in your mobile application. 

- :ref:`Create an {+service-short+} Schema from a {+frontend-schema+} <create-schema-from-rom>`: 
  Alternatively, if you are developing mobile-first and do not already have 
  data in your {+atlas-short+} cluster, you can translate your {+frontend-schema+} into 
  an {+service-short+} Schema for use with {+atlas-short+}. Regardless of the approach that you take, 
  when you configure both your {+atlas-short+} cluster and Mobile application to use 
  the respective data model, changes to the data model between the server 
  and client are auto-updated.

-------------------------------------------------------

.. note:: Link a {+atlas+} Data Source
   
   Your app must have at least one :ref:`linked data source
   <data-sources>` in order to define an {+service-short+} data model.
   
   You cannot use sync with a :ref:`serverless instance
   <serverless-caveats>` or :ref:`data lake <data-lake-caveats>`.
