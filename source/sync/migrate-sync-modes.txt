Atlas App Services Apps can have one of two Device Sync modes: 
:ref:`Partition-Based Sync <partition-based-sync>` and :ref:`Flexible Sync <sync>`.
Partition-Based Sync is an older mode and you should consider migrating to
Flexible Sync.

Migrating an App Services App that uses Partition-Based Sync to Flexible Sync is
an automatic process. Other than upgrading the SDK version, migrating Sync modes
doesn't require any changes to your client app code.

Migration results in Partition-Based Sync clients communicating with a
Flexible Sync backend. We recommend eventually :ref:`migrating your client app code
<realm-sync-migrate-client>` to also use Flexible Sync instead of
Partition-Based Sync.

Requirements
------------

Currently, the Swift and Kotlin client SDKs support migrating your App's backend from
Partition-Based Sync to Flexible Sync. The Java, .NET, Node.js, and
React Native SDKs do not support backend Sync mode migration yet.

App Services App:

- Currently use Partition-Based Sync

Linked Atlas Cluster:

- Use MongoDB 5.0 or later for Flexible Sync compatibility
- Enable :atlas:`storage auto-scaling </cluster-autoscaling/#configure-auto-scaling-options>`
- Be an M10+ Cluster Tier
- Have time-based :manual:`oplog </core/replica-set-oplog/>` setting enabled

Client apps:

- Minimum SDK version:

  - Realm Swift SDK v10.40.0
  - Realm Kotlin SDK v1.9.0
  
.. TODO: Update and add these as SDKs release.
..   - Realm .NET SDK v11.0.0
..   - Realm Node.js SDK v11.9.0
..   - Realm React Native SDK v11.9.0

- Have a :ref:`Client Reset Handler <client-resets>` configured.

.. _realm-sync-migrate-what-to-know:

What to Know Before Migrating
-----------------------------

Migrating your App's Sync mode involves changes that affect both client apps and
your App's backend. You should be aware of the effects and plan ahead.

- Client apps that don't meet the minimum SDK version requirement will not be
  able to sync after migration.
- How long a migration takes is directly proportional to the amount of data that
  needs to be migrated. The more data, the longer it will take to migrate.
- Migrations can be :ref:`canceled <realm-sync-migrate-cancel>` during the 
  migration or :ref:`reverted <realm-sync-migrate-revert>` within a certain 
  timeframe after the migration is finished.
- Progress notifications will not work after migration because Flexible Sync does
  not support them.
- Client apps that were connected to the Partition-Based Sync backend will 
  experience a client reset after the backend is migrated to Flexible Sync. You 
  should use a :ref:`client reset <handle-a-client-reset>` handler with recovery
  enabled so you don't lose any pending changes from before the client reset.
- Creating new tables in a migrated Flexible Sync backend using 
  :ref:`Development Mode <development-mode>` from a Partition-Based Sync client
  may lead to unexpected behavior.

.. _realm-sync-migrate-stages:

Migration Stages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can see your migration's stage in the App Services UI. There are three stages
to a Sync mode migration:

#. **Syncing Partition-Based Sync metadata** 
   
   At this stage, client apps can connect to your App's backend, but local writes 
   will not sync. These writes will be lost if you don't have a 
   :ref:`client reset handler <handle-a-client-reset>` to recover unsynced changes.
	 
   Clients will receive updates to synced collections, but won't be able to send
   uploads or receive upload acknowledgements.

#. **Building Flexible Sync metadata** 
   
   Clients cannot connect at this stage. The duration of this stage is directly
   proportional to the amount of data in synced collections.

#. **Completed migration** 

   :guilabel:`Manage Sync Migration` appears on the Device Sync page if the 
   migration hasn't been committed or reverted.

After the migration has finished, check out the :ref:`After Migration
<realm-sync-migrate-after>` section for more information about how
Partition-Based Sync clients interact with the Flexible Sync backend.

Migrate Partition-Based Sync to Flexible Sync
---------------------------------------------

After beginning migration from Partition-Based Sync to Flexible Sync, the process
is mostly automatic. However, you can control important parts of the migration.

During a migration, you can cancel it. After a migration, you can revert it 
or manually commit the migration.

Begin Migration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you begin a migration, make sure you're aware of the
:ref:`migration stages <realm-sync-migrate-stages>` and
:ref:`effects <realm-sync-migrate-what-to-know>`.

Migration generally has similar effects as :ref:`terminating <terminating-realm-sync>` 
and re-enabling Device Sync. There are some additional effects of migration:

- In the App Services UI, all configuration pages will be read-only. For
  example: the Rules, Schemas, Functions, Triggers, and more pages.
- Your App will experience a period of read-only Sync and then a 
  period of downtime.
- The new Flexible Sync configuration will set 
  :ref:`client max offline time <client-maximum-offline-time>` to 30 days.
- Storage in your Atlas cluster used by Device Sync metadata is temporarily doubled.
  Partition-Based Sync metadata and Flexible Sync metadata must temporarily co-exist. 
  Depending on the size of your synced data, this could affect billing every time you
  migrate. The duplicated metadata is removed after the migration is rolled back
  or committed.

**To migrate from Partition-Based Sync to Flexible Sync:** 

#. In the App Services UI, go to your App and select the Device Sync page.
#. At the top of the page, select :guilabel:`[Migrate to Flexible Sync]`.
   
   .. image:: /images/begin-migration.png
      :alt: Begin a migration
   
#. Read the information about migrating, then select 
   :guilabel:`Next: Migration Requirements`.
#. Ensure you meet the migration requirements, then select 
   :guilabel:`Start Migration`.

.. note:: Temporary Sync Disruption

   Clients will not be able to sync their local writes until the migration has
   completed.

After a migration is completed, Partition-Based Sync client apps will go through
a client reset. Then, they can communicate with your App's Flexible Sync backend.
You can disable and re-enable Flexible Sync and client apps will still
communicate with your backend.

If you re-enable Partitition-Based Sync you will lose the "migrated" status.
This means you'll need to do another migration if you want to use Flexible Sync
on the backend with Partition-Based Sync client apps.

Migrate Permissions and Rules
`````````````````````````````

Your App's permissions and rules will be automatically migrated if the Partition-Based
Sync rules have direct App Services Rules equivalents. This will override
previously-defined App Services Rules.

In step 4 above, you will see if your permissions and rules can be automatically
migrated. On the :guilabel:`Review Migration Process` step in the App Services UI,
look for :guilabel:`Rules & Permisssions`.

Some Partition-Based Sync rule strategies can't translate directly to App Services
Rules. You may need to manually migrate permissions that include:

- :json-operator:`%function` operator.

  :ref:`Function rules <pbs-function-rules>` are not compatible with Flexible Sync 
  and cannot be migrated.

- ``%or``, ``%not``, ``%nor``, ``%and`` expansions.

  These permissions may work, but there is enough nuance that you should test them
  to ensure expected behavior. Testing new permissions won't work on the App
  you are migrating. Instead, create a new Flexible Sync app to test your
  manually-migrated permissions. Then apply the tested permissions to the app
  you are migrating.

See the list of :ref:`Flexible Sync-compatible expansions <sync-compatible-expansions>`
for all supported expansions.

You should also check out the 
:ref:`Device Sync Permissions Guide <flexible-sync-permissions-guide>` for more
information about how to work with permissions.

.. _realm-sync-migrate-cancel:

Cancel Migration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can cancel a migration at any time while it is in progress. This will return
your App the Partition-Based Sync, with all settings as they were before the
migration started.

If you cancel a migration, you need to start over from the beginning with future
migration attempts.

**To cancel a migration:** 

#. In the App Services UI, go to your App and select the Device Sync page.
#. At the top of the page, in the notification banner, select
   :guilabel:`Stop Migration`.
   
   .. image:: /images/cancel-migration.png
      :alt: Cancel a migration
   
   This will cancel your migration. You will need to migrate again if you want to
   enable Flexible Sync in the future.

.. _realm-sync-migrate-commit:

Commit Migration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After your migration has completed, it is in an evaluation state. You can manually
commit the migration to make it permanent or revert the migration to return your
App to Partition-Based Sync.

If you don't commit or revert the migration, it will automatically commit
according to your 
:atlas:`minimum oplog window </cluster-additional-settings/#set-minimum-oplog-window>`. 
For example, if your minimum oplog window is 48 hours, you will have 48 hours to
revert your migration.

After a migration is committed, the old Partition-Based Sync metadata is deleted
and you cannot revert the migration.

**To manually commit a migration:** 

#. In the App Services UI, go to your App and select the Device Sync page.
#. At the top of the page, select the three dots next to 
   :guilabel:`Manage Sync Migration`.
#. From the list of options, select :guilabel:`Commit migration to Flexible Sync`.
   
   .. image:: /images/commit-migration.png
      :alt: Commit a migration
#. Confirm migration commit by typing "Commit", then select :guilabel:`Commit`.
   
   .. image:: /images/confirm-migration-commit.png
      :alt: Confirm migration commit
   
   This will commit your migration and you will not be able to recover your
   Partition-Based Sync Metadata.

.. _realm-sync-migrate-revert:

Revert Migration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can revert a migration after it has completed and before it has been committed.

Completed migrations are automatically committed in accordance with your 
:atlas:`minimum oplog window </atlas/cluster-additional-settings/#set-minimum-oplog-window>`.
You can increase or decrease the amount of time you have to 
revert a migration by adjusting the minimum oplog window.

You cannot revert a migration that has been committed.

Similar to canceling a migration, if you revert a migration, you need to 
start over from the beginning with future migration attempts.

**To revert a migration:** 

#. In the App Services UI, go to your App and select the Device Sync page.
#. At the top of the page, select the three dots next to 
   :guilabel:`Manage Sync Migration`.
#. From the list of options, select 
   :guilabel:`Revert back to Partition-Based Sync`.
   
   .. image:: /images/revert-migration.png
      :alt: Revert a migration
   
   This will revert your migration. You will need to migrate again if you 
   want to enable Flexible Sync in the future.

.. _realm-sync-migrate-after:

After Backend Migration
-----------------------

Your migrated backend uses a partition key field in your Realm object models
to map the Partition-Based Sync client objects to Flexible Sync equivalents on
the backend. If your object models don't have a partition key field, the
backend automatically injects one into every object the Partition-Based Sync
client creates.

These are some other characteristics of the injected field you should be aware
of:

- The injected field follows this structure: ``<yourPartitionKey> == 
  <yourPartitionValue>``. The field key is derived from your old
  Partition-Based Sync  **backend**  configuration. The value is derived from
  your current Partition-Based Sync  **client**  configuration.
- The injected field does not sync back to the client that created the object.
  This means the originating client won't be able to read the injected
  ``partitionKey`` field.

The Partition-Based Sync client automatically creates sync subscriptions for 
each table where ``partitionKey == partitionValue``. This will continue
until you :ref:`migrate your client app <realm-sync-migrate-client>` to
Flexible Sync.

After migrating your client app to Flexible Sync, the backend will stop injecting
the partition key field. If your client app relies on the partition key field for
managing sync subscriptions, you should add the parition key field to your
object models.

If you don't, objects created in new versions of your app will not be synced
to clients using older versions of your client app code.

.. _realm-sync-migrate-client:

Migrate Client App to Flexible Sync
-----------------------------------

After your App's backend has been migrated to Flexible Sync, we recommend
that you migrate your client app to Flexible Sync. When you migrate your
client app to Flexible Sync, the client will stop automatically creating
sync subscriptions for each Realm object model in your app's data model.

We also recommend removing all sync subscriptions and then creating new subscriptions
for your data. This is the clearest way to control what data is synced after a
migration. 

If you want to remove individual subscriptions, the automatically
generated subscriptions use a specific naming format: ``flx_migrated_`` + your 
object model's name. For example, a ``Person`` object model's subscription
name would be ``flx_migrated_Person``.

Refer to the SDK documentation for details about adding and removing
subscriptions:

- Java SDK
   :ref:`Flexible Sync - Java SDK <java-flexible-sync>`

- Kotlin SDK
   :ref:`Subscribe to Queryable Fields - Kotlin SDK <kotlin-subscriptions>`

- .NET SDK
   :ref:`Manage Flexible Sync Subscriptions - .NET SDK <dotnet-flexible-sync>`

- Node.js SDK
   :ref:`Flexible Sync - Node.js SDK <node-flexible-sync>`

- React Native SDK
   :ref:`Flexible Sync - React Native SDK <react-native-flexible-sync>`

- Swift SDK
   :ref:`Manage Flexible Sync Subscriptions - Swift SDK <swift-manage-flexible-sync-subscriptions>`

You can keep the automatically-generated subscriptions if you don't want to
remove and recreate them. But you should consider that because these 
subscriptions aren't created in your client code, they may make it harder to
maintain and extend client code.
