Rules
-----

{+service+} enforces data access rules for all requests to a synced cluster.
Sync rules are dynamic :ref:`JSON expressions <expressions>` that specify a
given user's ability to view and modify synced data.

The way Sync rules work depends on whether you are using
:ref:`Partition-Based Sync <partition-based-rules-and-permissions>` or
:ref:`Flexible Sync <flexible-sync-rules-and-permissions>`.

.. important:: Non-Sync Rules
   
   This page describes data access rules for synced clusters. Non-synced cluster
   use a different rules model that sync rules override. If sync is enabled for
   a cluster, any non-sync rules defined for the cluster do not apply.
   
   If your app does not use sync, check out :ref:`MongoDB Collection Rules
   <mongodb-rules>` for more information on rules for non-synced clusters.

Partition-Based Rules and Permissions
-------------------------------------

Whenever a user opens a synced realm from a client app, {+service-short+} evaluates your
app's rules and determines if the user has read and write permissions for the
:ref:`partition <sync-partitions>`. Users must have read permission to sync 
and read data in a realm and must have write permission to create, modify, 
or delete objects. Write permission implies read permission, so if a user 
has write permission then they also have read permission.

Partition-Based Sync Rule Behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sync rules apply to specific partitions and are coupled to your app's data model
by the partition key. Consider the following behavior when designing
your schemas to ensure that you have appropriate data access granularity and
don't accidentally leak sensitive information.

- Sync rules apply dynamically based on the user. One user may have full read &
  write access to a partition while another user has only read permissions or is
  unable to access the partition entirely. You control these permissions by
  defining :ref:`JSON expressions <expressions>`.

- Sync rules apply equally to all objects in a partition. If a user has read
  or write permission for a given partition then they can read or modify all
  synced fields of any object in the partition.

- Write permissions require read permissions, so a user with write access to a
  partition also has read access regardless of the defined read permission
  rules.

.. _partition-based-sync-permissions:

Partition-Based Sync Permissions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+service-short+} enforces dynamic, user-specific read and write permissions to secure the
data in each :ref:`partition <sync-partitions>`. You define permissions with
:ref:`JSON rule expressions <expressions>` that control whether or not a given
user has read or write access to the data in a given partition. {+service-short+} evaluates
a user's permissions every time they open a synced realm.

.. tip::
   
   Your rule expressions can use JSON expansions like
   :json-expansion:`%%partition` and :json-expansion:`%%user` to dynamically
   determine a user's permissions based on the context of their request.

Key Concepts
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _sync-read-permissions:

Read Permissions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A user with read permissions for a given partition can view all fields of any
object in the corresponding synced realm. Read permissions do not permit a user
to modify data.

.. _sync-write-permissions:

Write Permissions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A user with write permissions for a given partition can modify the value of any
field of any object in the corresponding synced realm. Write permissions require
read permissions, so any user that can modify data can also view that data
before and after it's modified.

.. _sync-permission-strategies:

Permission Strategies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can structure your read and write permission expressions as a set of
permission strategies that apply to your :ref:`partition strategy
<partition-strategies>`. The following strategies outline common approaches that
you might take to define sync read and write permissions for your app.

Global Permissions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can define global permissions that apply to all users for all partitions.
This is, in essence, a choice to not implement user-specific permissions in
favor of universal read or write permissions that apply to all users.

To define a global read or write permission, specify a boolean value or a
:ref:`JSON expression <expressions>` that always evaluates to the same boolean
value.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 50 50

   * - Example
     - Description

   * - .. code-block:: json
          
          true
     
     - The expression ``true`` means that all users have the given access
       permissions for all partitions.

   * - .. code-block:: json
          
          false
     
     - The expression ``false`` means that no users have the given access
       permissions for any partitions.

   * - .. code-block:: json
          
          { "%%true": true }
     
     - This expression always evaluates to ``true``, so it's effectively the
       same as directly specifying ``true``.

Permissions for Specific Partitions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can define permissions that apply to a specific partition or a groups of
partitions by explicitly specifying their partition values.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 50 50

   * - Example
     - Description

   * - .. code-block:: json
     
          { "%%partition": "PUBLIC" }
     
     - This expression means that all users have the given access permissions
       for data with a partition value of ``"Public"``.

   * - .. code-block:: json
     
          {
            "%%partition": {
              "$in": [
                "PUBLIC (NA)",
                "PUBLIC (EMEA)",
                "PUBLIC (APAC)"
              ]
            }
          }
     
     - This expression means that all users have the given access permissions
       for data with any of the specified partition values.

Permissions for Specific Users
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can define permissions that apply to a specific user or a group of users by
explicitly specifying their ID values.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 50 50

   * - Example
     - Description

   * - .. code-block:: json
          
          { "%%user.id": "5f4863e4d49bd2191ff1e623" }
     
     - This expression means that the user with id
       ``"5f4863e4d49bd2191ff1e623"`` has the given access permissions for data
       in any partition.

   * - .. code-block:: json
          
          { 
            "%%user.id": {
              "$in": [
                "5f4863e4d49bd2191ff1e623",
                "5f48640dd49bd2191ff1e624",
                "5f486417d49bd2191ff1e625"
              ]
            }
          }
     
     - This expression means that any user with one of the specified user ID
       values has the given access permissions for data in any partition.

Permissions Based on User Data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can define permissions that apply to users based on specific data defined in
their :ref:`custom user data <custom-user-data>` document, metadata fields, or
other data from an authentication provider.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 50 50

   * - Example
     - Description

   * - .. code-block:: json
     
          { "%%user.custom_data.readPartitions" : "%%partition" }
     
     - This expression means that a user has read access to a
       partition if the partition value is listed in the ``readPartitions``
       field of their custom user data.

   * - .. code-block:: json
     
          { "%%user.data.writePartitions" : "%%partition" }
     
     - This expression means that a user has write access to a
       partition if the partition value is listed in the
       ``data.writePartitions`` field of their user object.

Function Rules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can define complex dynamic permissions by evaluating a :ref:`function
<functions>` that returns a boolean value. This is useful for permission schemes
that require you to access external systems or other custom logic that you
cannot express solely in JSON expressions.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 50 50

   * - Example
     - Description
   
   * - .. code-block:: json
          
          {
            "%%true": {
              "%function": {
                "name": "canReadPartition",
                "arguments": ["%%partition"]
              }
            }
          }
       
       .. code-block:: javascript
          
          // canReadPartition
          exports = async (partition) => {
            const cluster = context.services.get("mongodb-atlas");
            const permissions = cluster
              .db("myApp")
              .collection("permissions");
            const { canRead } = await permissions.findOne({ partition });
            return canRead.includes(context.user.id);
          }
     
     - This expression calls the ``canReadPartition`` function and
       passes in the partition value as its first and only argument. The
       function looks up the user's permissions for the partition from a MongoDB
       collection and then returns a boolean that indicates if the user can read
       data in the requested partition.

.. _flexible-sync-rules-and-permissions:
.. _flexible-sync-roles:

Flexible Sync Session Roles and Rules
-------------------------------------

In flexible sync, a **session role** determines which permissions apply for the
duration of a sync session.

You define Flexible Sync session roles on a per-collection basis. Each
"collection" when using {+sync+} corresponds to a Realm Object type.

When a user begins a session by opening a synced realm, {+service-short+} determines which
session role applies for the user for each collection in play. {+service-short+} considers
session roles in the order that you defined them in the configuration. It
evaluates each session role's "apply when" expression until one evaluates to
true. If no session role applies, the user has no permissions for that
collection.

.. tip::

   Your session role "apply when" expressions can use :ref:`JSON expansions
   <expansions>` to refer to :ref:`user metadata
   <configure-user-metadata-on-the-backend>` and :ref:`custom user data
   <custom-user-data>` and even call functions to determine the given user's
   role. However, because {+service-short+} only evaluates session roles at the start of a
   session -- that is, before any query for specific documents -- you can't
   refer to a document or its field values to determine whether the session role
   applies.

The session role stays assigned for the duration of the session. If you make
changes to an applied session role while a user is in the middle of a session,
{+service-short+} does not evaluate the updated session role until the next time
the user starts a session. Likewise, if something changes that would qualify the
user for a different session role, the user's current session role does not
change until the next session.

.. _flex-sync-expansions-caveat:

.. important::

   {+service-short+} triggers a :ref:`client reset <client-resets>` if anything about the
   session role changed since the previous session.

   At the start of a session, {+service-short+} expands all JSON expansions in the "apply
   when", read, and write expressions and stores the result. This has the following
   implications:

   - If the value changes during a session, {+service-short+} continues to use the value as it was at the time of session start.
   - On the next session, if the value is different from what it was at the start of this session, {+service-short+} triggers a client reset.
   - You cannot use the :json-operator:`%function` operator in read and
     write rules. Functions would not operate on a per-document basis.
   - You cannot store permissions information (such as "which document IDs may this user access?") in the user object.


.. _flexible-sync-roles-json-reference:

Flexible Sync Roles JSON Reference
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A **Role** object can specify a role for a specific collection or the default
role applied to all collections. You define field-level permissions with a
**Fields** object in the Role.

A **Role** object has the following properties:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 20 10 50

   * - Key
     - Value Type
     - Required
     - Notes

   * - name
     - string
     - Yes
     - The name of the role.

   * - applyWhen
     - JSON expression
     - Yes
     - The rules system evaluates the expression at session start time
       and assigns the first role whose ``applyWhen`` expression evaluates to
       true.

   * - write
     - JSON expression
     - No
     - The rules system evaluates the expression for each document to
       determine if the user may write to the given document. If true, the
       system implicitly grants read access. The expression may only refer to
       the pre-specified **queryable fields** of the document.

   * - read
     - JSON expression
     - No
     - The rules system evaluates the expression for each document to
       determine if the user may write to the given document. If ``write``
       evaluates to true, the system implicitly grants read access regardless of
       the result of ``read``. The expression may only refer to the
       pre-specified **queryable fields** of the document.

   * - fields
     - Fields object
     - No
     - Specifies field-level permissions in addition to document-level
       permission. If omitted, document-level rules apply.

   * - additional_fields
     - Object
     - No
     - Specifies permissions for fields not explicitly listed in the
       ``fields`` object.

   * - additional_fields.read
     - boolean
     - No
     - Specifies whether read access should be granted for fields not
       explicitly listed in the ``fields`` object.
       
   * - additional_fields.write
     - boolean
     - No
     - Specifies whether write access should be granted for fields not
       explicitly listed in the ``fields`` object.

The **Fields** object defines permissions for specific fields. The keys of the
fields object are names of the field:

   * - *arbitrary field name*
     - **Permissions** object
     - No
     - Specifies the field-level permissions for the given field.

The **Permissions** object has the following properties:

   * - Key
     - Value Type
     - Required

   * - write
     - boolean
     - No
     - If true, the system grants read and write access. If undefined, the system assumes 

   * - read
     - boolean
     - No
     - If true, the system grants read access.

   * - fields
     - Fields object
     - No
     - For embedded object fields. Specifies field-level permissions.

   * - additional_fields
     - Object
     - No
     - For embedded object fields. Specifies permissions for fields not
       explicitly listed in the ``fields`` object.

   * - additional_fields.read
     - boolean
     - No
     - For embedded object fields. Specifies whether read access should be
       granted for fields not explicitly listed in the ``fields`` object.
       
   * - additional_fields.write
     - boolean
     - No
     - For embedded object fields. Specifies whether write access should be
       granted for fields not explicitly listed in the ``fields`` object.


.. example::

   The following JSON object describes a **Role** for a team admin:

   .. code-block:: json

    {
      "name": "TeamAdmin",
      "applyWhen": { "%%user.custom_data.isAdmin": true },
      "read": {},
      "write": { "teamId": "%%user.custom_data.teamId" },
      "fields": {
        "address": {
          "fields": {
            "zipCode": {
              "write": false,
              "read": true
            }
          },
          "additional_fields": {
            "write": true
          }
        },
        "name": {}
      },
      "additional_fields": {
        "write": false,
        "read": false
      }
    }
  
   The following table explains the effect of each part of the Role:

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 50 50

      * - Role JSON
        - Effect

      * - ``"read": {}``
        - May access any document for reading.

      * - ``"write": { "teamId": "%%user.custom_data.teamId" }``
        - May access a document for writing if the document's ``teamId`` field
          equals the user's custom data ``teamId``. This requires ``teamId`` to
          be declared as a queryable field in the Sync configuration.

      * - .. code-block:: json

            "fields": {
              "address": {
                "fields": {
                  "zipCode": {
                    "write": false,
                    "read": true
                  }
                },

              },
              "name": {}
            },

        - May write to any field of the ``address`` embedded object except
          ``zipCode``. May also write to the ``name`` field.
      
      * - .. code-block:: json

            "additional_fields": {
              "write": false,
              "read": false
            }

        - May not read or write any other fields despite having document-level
          access to the document.

   * - Expansion
     - Can Use in "Apply When"?
     - Can Use in Read & Write Rules?
   
   * - :json-expansion:`%%true`, :json-expansion:`%%false`
     - Yes
     - Yes
   
   * - :json-expansion:`%%values`, :json-expansion:`%%environment`
     - Yes
     - Yes with an :ref:`important caveat <flex-sync-expansions-caveat>`
   
   * - :json-expansion:`%%request`
     - No
     - No
   
   * - :json-expansion:`%%user`

   * - :json-expansion:`%%this`, :json-expansion:`%%prev`, :json-expansion:`%%root`,  :json-expansion:`%%prevRoot`
     - No. These expansions refer to the document. {+service-short+} evaluates "apply when" expressions at session start, so there's no document to evaluate.
     - No. These expansions might access non-queryable fields of the document, which is not possible.
   
   * - :json-expansion:`%%partition`
     - No
     - No
   
   * - :json-operator:`%stringToOid`, :json-operator:`%oidToString`
     - Yes
     - No
   
   * - :json-operator:`%function`
     - Yes
     - No. {+service-short+} expands the expansions at the start of the session, so the function would not operate on a per-document basis.
   
   * - :json-operator:`$exists`
     - Yes
     - Yes
   
   * - :json-operator:`$in`, :json-operator:`$nin`
     - Yes
     - Yes. However, note that you cannot currently have an array field as a queryable field on a document.
   
   * - :json-operator:`$eq`, :json-operator:`$ne`, :json-operator:`$gt`, :json-operator:`$gte`, :json-operator:`$lt`, :json-operator:`$lte`  
     - Yes
     - Yes

.. _default-roles:

Default Roles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can create one or more default session roles that apply across all
collections. If a collection does not have any custom session roles
defined, session role resolution reverts to default session roles. 

.. tip::

   Because session roles apply only at the session level and not on a
   per-document level, most apps only need one (default) session role
   with per-document logic in that session role's read
   and write rules. With Flexible Sync, session roles can be thought of
   as a way to group read and write rule expressions to organize
   your code.


Flexible Sync Rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You define a read and write rule expression pair for every session role.

Rule expressions can refer to the :ref:`queryable fields
<queryable-fields>` of your data model.

In response to a Flexible Sync subscription query, {+service-short+} evaluates the
read and write rule expressions for each document that matches the query.
The client only receives documents where the rule expression evaluates to "true".

Consider the following behavior when designing your schemas 
to ensure that you have appropriate data access granularity and don't 
accidentally leak sensitive information.

- Sync rules apply dynamically based on the value of the queryable field or 
  user metadata. One user may have full read & write access to a document 
  while another user has only read permissions or is unable to access the 
  document. You control these permissions by defining 
  :ref:`JSON expressions <expressions>`.

- Write permissions require read permissions, so a user with write access to a
  collection also has read access regardless of the defined (or undefined) read
  permission rule.

.. seealso::

   For a guide to setting up flexible sync with common permissions models, see
   :ref:`flexible-sync-permissions-guide`.

.. _flexible-sync-read-permissions:

Read Permissions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A user with read permissions for a given collection can view all fields of any
object matching the client-side query. Read permissions do not permit a user
to modify data.

.. _flexible-sync-write-permissions:

Write Permissions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A user with write permissions for a given collection can modify the value of any
field of any object matching the client-side query. Write permissions require
read permissions, so any user that can modify data can also view that data
before and after it's modified.

.. _flexible-sync-field-level-permissions:

Field-Level Permissions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can refine document-level permissions on a per-field basis with the
``fields`` and ``additional_fields`` properties of the **Role** configuration
object.

If the user does not have document-level permissions to a document, field-level
permissions cannot grant access to that document. Field-level permissions can
only refine the permissions on documents that a user can access. For example,
you can use field-level permissions to forbid writes on a specific field of a
document that a user can otherwise write to.

The ``additional_fields`` property defines the field-level permissions for
fields that you don't explicitly define in the ``fields`` object. If you don't
define ``additional_fields`` or its read/write properties, the system uses the
corresponding document-level permission for any field not mentioned in
``fields``.

In practice, you would use ``additional_fields`` with ``fields`` to greatly
constrain document-level read or write access to a few specified fields.
