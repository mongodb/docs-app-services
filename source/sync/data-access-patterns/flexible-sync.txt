Overview
--------

There are two Sync modes: Flexible Sync and the older Partition-Based Sync. We
recommend using Flexible Sync. For more information about Partition-Based Sync,
refer to :ref:`partition-based-sync`.

Flexible Sync lets you define a query in the client, and sync only the objects
that match the query. With client-side subscriptions, client applications can:

- Maintain queries
- React to changes
- Add, change, or delete queries

Together with :ref:`rules and permissions <sync-rules>`, Flexible Sync 
provides a powerful way to configure Sync around your business logic.

.. seealso::

   For a guide to setting up flexible sync with common permissions models, see
   :ref:`flexible-sync-permissions-guide`.

When a client makes a query, Atlas App Services searches the server-side
data set for documents matching the query. Then, the sync engine applies 
a set of rules to determine which documents in the results set the user 
should be able to access. App Services returns only the matching 
documents where the user has read or read/write access, and assigns the 
user the appropriate permissions.

Client applications can add, update, or remove queries dynamically at 
run-time from the device.

.. _queryable-fields:

Queryable Fields
----------------

When you configure Flexible Sync, you specify one or more fields 
from your :ref:`App Services Schema <sync-schema-overview>` that your client 
application can query. 

.. example::

   In a task tracker app, you might set ``assignee`` or ``owner`` 
   as queryable fields. On the client side, you can then query for tasks 
   whose ``assignee`` or ``owner`` matches the logged-in user. 

Queryable fields apply across all collections in an app's App Services Schema.
You can use :ref:`rules and permissions 
<flexible-sync-rules-and-permissions>` to configure more granular access 
control on individual collections.

.. _flexible-sync-eligible-field-types:

Eligible Field Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Flexible Sync only supports top-level primitive fields with a scalar type as 
queryable fields. You can also include arrays of these primitives as queryable 
fields. Flexible Sync does not support embedded objects or arrays of 
objects as queryable fields.

.. seealso:: Realm Query Language - Flexible Sync Limitations

   For information on the queries you can perform on these fields, see:
   :ref:`flexible-sync-rql-limitations`


.. _flexible-sync-reserved-field-names:

Reserved Field Names
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/reserved-field-names.rst

Performance and Storage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Queryable fields use storage on the backing Atlas cluster. The more queryable
fields you configure, the more storage you use on the backing cluster. You can
configure up to 10 queryable fields per application for Flexible Sync.

.. seealso::

.. _get-started-flexible-sync:

Get Started with Flexible Sync
------------------------------

Define a Schema
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use Flexible Sync, create a schema for your app. The :ref:`eligible 
fields <flexible-sync-eligible-field-types>` in your schema become queryable fields
you can select when you enable Flexible Sync.

If you're not yet ready to create a schema, you can manually define queryable
fields with :ref:`Development Mode <development-mode>`.

.. seealso::

   :ref:`create-schema-for-backend-realm-app`

Enable Sync
~~~~~~~~~~~

After you have defined a schema, or decided to create your data model on the 
client side and use :ref:`Development Mode <development-mode>` to 
define a schema, you can enable Flexible Sync. 

During the process of enabling Sync, you select queryable fields and 
define roles that control how users can access your data. 

.. seealso::

   :ref:`enable-flexible-sync`

Select Fields to Query
``````````````````````

When you enable Flexible Sync, you can select queryable fields in two ways:

- If you have defined your schema, you can select queryable fields from 
  :ref:`eligible fields <flexible-sync-eligible-field-types>` in your schema.
- If you are using :ref:`Development Mode <development-mode>`, you 
  can type a queryable field name that matches an :ref:`eligible field type 
  <flexible-sync-eligible-field-types>` in your client application.

You can configure up to 10 queryable fields per app. These 
fields apply across all of the collections in your application.

Define Roles
````````````

When a user submits a query to the app, Sync determines which role 
applies for the user. 

Roles consist of:

- A role name
- A rule for when to apply the role 
- Read and write permissions for users with the role 

You can define multiple roles to tailor your access permissions for each
collection. Collections can have more than one role, or none at all. 

You can also create default roles, which do not apply to a specific collection.
Instead, default roles apply to any collection where you do not define custom 
roles.

.. _flexible-sync-query-subscription:

Create Queries in Your Client Application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With Flexible Sync enabled, you can start creating queries from 
your client application. 

The Realm SDKs provide methods to create, update, and remove queries 
from the client application. The SDKs use subscriptions to maintain those 
queries on the client side. Through these subscriptions, your applications
sync objects with the backend app and can watch for and react to changes.

.. _optimize-asymmetric-sync:

Optimize Sync with Asymmetric Sync (Optional)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Asymmetric Sync is a sync strategy that is optimized for applications 
with heavy client-side *insert-only* workloads. You enable it for one or more 
collections. It supports writing to any collection type, including an 
Atlas time-series collection. 

For example, an IoT app that frequently logs sensor data has a significant 
write workload and no read workload. The device may also be offline 
for extended periods of time. Asymmetric Sync bypasses some of the processing 
required for bi-directional sync, significantly improving write speed to an 
Atlas collection. 

Other use cases include writing immutable data, such as invoices from a retail 
app, or logging application events, neither of which requires conflict 
resolution.

You can apply Asymmetric Sync to individual collections. This means 
your app can use Asymmetric Sync to write some data, but bi-directional 
Flexible Sync on other collections. 

.. important::

   Asymmetric Sync collections are only for writing data. You cannot use 
   Flexible Sync queries against these collections. Instead, use 
   :ref:`data-sources`.

You configure and enable Asymmetric Sync in the :guilabel:`Advanced Options` 
section of the Sync set up page. For more information on setting up Flexible 
Sync with Asymmetric Sync, see :ref:`enable-flexible-sync`.

After you have enabled Asymmetric Sync, you implement it in the client app 
via the client SDKs.

.. TODO: add link to the js SDK

.. note:: SDK Support

   The JavaScript SDK supports Asymmetric Sync. Support in the other SDKs is 
   forthcoming.
