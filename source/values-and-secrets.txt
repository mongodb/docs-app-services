As of September 2024, the Atlas Device SDKs and HTTPS Endpoints are deprecated
and will reach end of life in September 2025. Due to this deprecation,
Values and Secrets will be primarily used by Functions associated with Triggers.
For that reason, the Values and Secrets documentation has been to
`MongoDB Atlas Documentation -> Triggers/Functions
<https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-ui/triggers/functions/>`__.

For more details, refer to :ref:`app-services-deprecation`.
